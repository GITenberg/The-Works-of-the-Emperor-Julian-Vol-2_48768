          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sixth
          Oration is a sermon or rather a scolding addressed to the New
          Cynics, and especially to one of their number who had ventured to
          defame the memory of Diogenes. In the fourth Christian century the
          Cynic mode of life was adopted by many, but the vast majority were
          illiterate men who imitated the Cynic shamelessness of manners but
          not the genuine discipline, the self-sufficiency (αὐτάρκεια) which
          had ennobled the lives of Antisthenes, Diogenes and Crates. To the
          virtues of these great men Julian endeavours to recall the
          worthless Cynics of his day. In the two centuries that had elapsed
          since Lucian wrote, for the edification of degenerate Cynics,<a id=
          "noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> the
          Life of the Cynic Demonax, the dignified and witty friend of
          Epictetus, the followers of that sect had still further
          deteriorated. The New Cynics may be compared with the worst type of
          mendicant friar of the Middle Ages; and Julian saw in their
          assumption of the outward signs of Cynicism, the coarse cloak, the
          staff and wallet, and long hair, the same hypocrisy and greed that
          characterised certain of the Christian monks of his day.<a id=
          "noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> The
          resemblances <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
          003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          between the Christians and the Cynics had already been pointed out
          by Aristides,<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
          "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> and
          while in Julian's eyes they were equally impious, he has an
          additional grievance against the Cynics in that they brought
          discredit on philosophy. Like the Christians they were unlettered,
          they were disrespectful to the gods whom Julian was trying to
          restore, they had flattered and fawned on Constantius, and far from
          practising the austerities of Diogenes they were no better than
          parasites on society.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this as in
          the Seventh Oration Julian's aim is to reform the New Cynics, but
          still more to demonstrate the essential unity of philosophy. He
          sympathised profoundly with the tenets of Cynicism, and ranked
          Diogenes with Socrates as a moral teacher. He reminds the Cynics
          whom he satirises that the famous admonition of Diogenes to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“countermark”</span><a id="noteref_4" name=
          "noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“forge”</span> a new coinage is not to be
          taken as an excuse for license and impudence, but like the Delphic
          precept <span class="tei tei-q">“Know Thyself”</span> warns all
          philosophers to accept no traditional authority, no convention that
          has not been examined and approved by the reason of the individual.
          His conviction that all philosophical tenets are in harmony if
          rightly understood, gives a peculiar earnestness to his Apologia
          for Diogenes. The reference in the first paragraph to the summer
          solstice seems to indicate that the Oration was written before
          Julian left Constantinople in order to prepare for the Persian
          campaign.</p>

          conceited, and who refuses to take cold baths for fear they may
          injure him, though he has a very strong constitution and is lusty
          and in the prime of life, and this too though the Sun-god is now
          nearing the summer solstice. Moreover he even ridicules the eating
          of octopus and says that Diogenes paid a sufficient penalty for his
          folly and vanity in that he perished of this diet<a id="noteref_9"
          name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> as
          though by a draught of hemlock. So far indeed is he advanced in
          wisdom that he knows for certain that death is an evil. Yet this
          even the wise Socrates thought he did not know, yes and after him
          Diogenes as well. At any rate when Antisthenes<a id="noteref_10"
          name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> was
          suffering from a long and incurable illness Diogenes handed him a
          dagger with these words, <span class="tei tei-q">“In case you need
          the aid of a friend.”</span> So convinced was he that there is
          nothing terrible or grievous in death. But we who have inherited
          his staff know out of our greater wisdom that death is a calamity.
          And we say that sickness is even more terrible than death, and cold
          harder to bear than sickness. For the man who is sick is often
          tenderly nursed, so that his ill-health is straightway converted
          into a luxury, especially if he be rich. Indeed I myself, by Zeus,
          have observed that certain persons are more luxurious in sickness
          than in health, though even in health they were conspicuous for
          luxury. And so it once occurred to me to say to certain of my
          friends that it were better for those men to be servants than
          masters, and to be poor and more naked than the lily of the
          field<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=
          "#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> than
          to be rich as they now are. For they would have ceased being at
          once sick and luxurious. The fact is that some people think it a
          fine thing to make a display of their ailments and to play the part
          of luxurious invalids. But, says someone, is not a man who has to
          endure cold and to support heat really more miserable than the
          sick? Well, at any rate he has no comforts to mitigate his
          sufferings.)</p>

          say, those who are now aiming to be Cynics will, I am sure, be none
          the worse for it: and if they are unconvinced but cherish aims that
          are brilliant and noble, and set themselves above my argument not
          in words only but in deeds, then my discourse will at any rate put
          no hindrance in their way. But if there are others already enslaved
          by greed or self-indulgence, or to sum it up briefly in a single

          is a fact that Cynicism is a branch of philosophy, and by no means

          philosophy, as some people do, as the art of arts and the science
          of sciences or as an effort to become like God, as far as one may,

          follows that he who knows himself will know not only about his soul
          but his body also. And it will not be enough to know that a man is
          a soul employing a body, but he will also investigate the essential
          nature of the soul, and then trace out its faculties. And not even
          this alone will be enough for him, but in addition he will
          investigate whatever exists in us nobler and more divine than the
          soul, that something which we all believe in without being taught
          and regard as divine, and all in common suppose to be established
          in the heavens. Then again, as he investigates the first principles
          of the body he will observe whether it is composite or simple; then
          proceeding systematically he will observe its harmony and the
          influences that affect it and its capacity and, in a word, all that
          it needs to ensure its permanence. And in the next place he will
          also observe the first principles of certain arts by which the body
          is assisted to that permanence, for instance, medicine, husbandry
          and the like. And of such arts as are useless and superfluous he
          will not be wholly ignorant, since these too have been devised to
          humour the emotional part of our souls. For though he will avoid
          the persistent study of these last, because he thinks such
          persistent study disgraceful, and will avoid what seems to involve
          hard work in those subjects; nevertheless he will not, generally
          speaking, remain in ignorance of their apparent nature and what
          parts of the soul they suit. Reflect therefore, whether
          self-knowledge does not control every science and every art, and
          moreover whether it does not include the knowledge of universals.
          For to know things divine through the divine part in us, and mortal
          things too through the part of us that is mortal—this the oracle
          declared to be the duty of the living organism that is midway
          between these, namely man; because individually he is mortal, but
          regarded as a whole he is immortal, and moreover, singly and
          individually, is compounded of a mortal and an immortal part.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(For it is in
          knowledge that the gods surpass ourselves. And it may well be that
          with them also what ranks as noblest is self-knowledge. In
          proportion then as they are nobler than we in their essential
          nature, that self-knowledge of theirs is a knowledge of higher
          things. Therefore, I say, let no one divide philosophy into many
          kinds or cut it up into many parts, or rather let no one make it
          out to be plural instead of one. For even as truth is one, so too
          philosophy is one. But it is not surprising that we travel to it
          now by one road, now by another. For if any stranger, or, by Zeus,
          any one of her oldest inhabitants wished to go up to Athens, he
          could either sail or go by road, and if he travelled by land he
          could, I suppose, take either the broad highways or the paths and
          roads that are short cuts. And moreover he could either sail along
          the coasts or, like the old man of Pylos,<a id="noteref_23" name=

          one try to refute me by pointing out that some philosophers in
          travelling by those very roads have been known to lose their way,
          and arriving in some other place have been captivated, as though by
          Circe or the Lotus-Eaters, that is to say by pleasure or opinion or
          some other bait, and so have failed to go straight forward and
          attain their goal. Rather he must consider those who in every one
          of the philosophic sects did attain the highest rank, and he will
          find that all their doctrines agree.)</p>

          would therefore be absurd that God should not know himself. For he
          will know nothing at all about other things if he be ignorant of
          himself. For he is himself everything, seeing that in himself and
          near himself he keeps the causes of all things that in any way
          whatever have existence, whether they be immortal causes of things
          immortal, or causes of perishable things, though themselves not
          mortal or perishable; for imperishable and ever-abiding are the
          causes of perpetual generation for the perishable world. But this

          that they too held the maxim <span class="tei tei-q">“Know

          composed on this very subject, but even more from what they made
          the end and aim of their philosophic teaching. For this end of
          theirs was life in harmony with nature, and this it is impossible
          for any man to attain who does not know who and of what nature he
          is. For a man who does not know himself will certainly not know
          what it is becoming for him to do; just as he who does not know the
          nature of iron will not know whether it is suitable to cut with or
          not, and how iron must be treated so that it may be put to its
          proper use. For the moment however I have said enough to show that
          philosophy is one, and that, to speak generally, all philosophers
          have a single aim though they arrive at that aim by different
          roads. And now let us consider the Cynic philosophy.)</p>

          had composed treatises with any serious purpose and not merely with

          I hold on the subject; and then, if they proved to be in harmony
          with those original doctrines, he could not attack me for bearing
          false witness; but if they proved not to be in harmony, then he

          as I said, nothing of that sort exists. For the much-talked-of
          tragedies of Diogenes are now said to be the work of a certain
          Philiscus<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href=
          "#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> of
          Aegina; though even if they were by Diogenes there would be nothing
          out of the way in a wise man's jesting, since many philosophers
          have been known to do so. For Democritus also, we are told, used to
          laugh when he saw men taking things seriously. Well then I say we
          must not pay any attention to their frivolous writings, like men
          who have no desire at all to learn anything of serious interest.
          Such men when they arrive at a prosperous city abounding in
          sacrifices and secret rites of many kinds, and containing within it
          countless holy priests who dwell in the sacred enclosures, priests
          who for this very purpose, I mean in order to purify everything
          that is within their gates, have expelled all that is sordid and
          superfluous and vicious from the city, public baths and brothels,
          and retail shops, and everything of the sort without exception:
          such men, I say, having come as far as the quarter where all such
          things are, do not enter the city itself. Surely a man who, when he
          comes upon the things that have been expelled, thinks that this is
          the city, is despicable indeed if he depart on the instant, but
          still more despicable if he stay in that lower region, when he
          might by taking but a step across the threshold behold Socrates
          himself. For I will borrow those famous phrases of Alcibiades in
          his praise of Socrates,<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href=
          "#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> and I
          assert that the Cynic philosophy is very like those images of
          Silenus that sit in the shops of the statuaries, which the
          craftsmen make with pipes or flutes in their hands, but when you
          open them you see that inside they contain statues of the gods.
          Accordingly, that we may not make that sort of mistake and think
          that his jesting was sober earnest (for though there is a certain
          use even in those jests, yet Cynicism itself is something very
          different, as I shall presently try to prove), let us consider it
          in due course from its actual practice and pursue it like hounds
          that track down wild beasts in the chase.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now the founder
          of this philosophy to whom we are to attribute it, in the first
          instance, is not easy to discover, even though some think that the
          title belongs to Antisthenes and Diogenes. At least the saying of
          Oenomaus<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=
          "#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> seems
          to be not without good grounds: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Cynic
          philosophy is neither Antisthenism nor Diogenism.”</span> Moreover
          the better sort of Cynics assert that in addition to the other
          blessings bestowed on us by mighty Heracles, it was he who
          bequeathed to mankind the noblest example of this mode of
          life.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href=
          "#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> But
          for my part, while I desire to speak with due reverence of the gods
          and of those who have attained to their functions, I still believe
          that even before Heracles, not only among the Greeks but among the
          barbarians also, there were men who practised this philosophy. For
          it seems to be in some ways a universal philosophy, and the most
          natural, and to demand no special study whatsoever. But it is
          enough simply to choose the honourable by desiring virtue and
          avoiding evil; and so there is no need to turn over countless
          books. For as the saying goes, <span class="tei tei-q">“Much
          learning does not teach men to have understanding.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> Nor is
          it necessary to subject oneself to any part of such a discipline as
          they must undergo who enter other philosophic sects. Nay it is
          enough merely to hearken to the Pythian god when he enjoins these
          two precepts, <span class="tei tei-q">“Know Thyself,”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Falsify the common currency.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> Hence
          it becomes evident to us that the founder of this philosophy is he
          who, I believe, is the cause of all the blessings that the Greeks
          enjoy, the universal leader, law-giver and king of Hellas, I mean
          the god of Delphi.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href=
          "#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> And
          since it was not permitted that he should be in ignorance of aught,
          the peculiar fitness of Diogenes did not escape his notice. And he
          made him incline to that philosophy, not by urging his commands in
          words alone, as he does for other men, but in very deed he
          instructed him symbolically as to what he willed, in two words,
          when he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Falsify the common
          currency.”</span> For <span class="tei tei-q">“Know Thyself”</span>
          he addressed not only to Diogenes, but to other men also and still
          does: for it stands there engraved in front of his shrine. And so
          we have at last discovered the founder of this philosophy, even as
          the divine Iamblichus also declares, yes, and we have discovered
          its leading men as well, namely Antisthenes and Diogenes and
          Crates;<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href=
          "#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          aim and end of whose lives was, I think, to know themselves, to
          despise vain opinions, and to lay hold of truth with their whole
          understanding; for truth, alike for gods and men, is the beginning
          of every good thing;<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href=

          was, I think, for her sake that Plato and Pythagoras and Socrates
          and the Peripatetic philosophers and Zeno spared no pains, because
          they wished to know themselves, and not to follow vain opinions but
          to track down truth among all things that are.)</p><span class=

          same answer, and moreover he will expressly enjoin on us to read
          his dialogue the Crito,<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href=
          "#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> where
          Socrates is shown warning us not to take heed of such things. At
          any rate what he says is: <span class="tei tei-q">“But why, my dear
          good Crito, are we so concerned about the opinion of the
          multitude?”</span> And now are we to ignore all this evidence, and
          without further question fence off from one another and force apart
          men whom the passion for truth, the scorn of opinion, and unanimity
          in zeal for virtue have joined together? And if Plato chose to
          achieve his aim through words, whereas for Diogenes deeds sufficed,
          does the latter on that account deserve to be criticised by you?
          Nay, consider whether that same method of his be not in every
          respect superior; since we see that Plato for himself forswore
          written compositions. <span class="tei tei-q">“For”</span> he
          says,<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=
          "#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“there are no writings by Plato nor ever
          will be, and what now pass current as his are the work of Socrates,
          the ever fair and ever young.”</span> Why then should we not from
          the practice of Diogenes study the character of the Cynic
          philosophy?)</p>

          Then is it not absurd for a man to take into account such parts, I

          either incomplete in itself or perfect but hindered by other things
          many and various, which brings about our apprehension of externals,
          it would not even be possible for us to apprehend the objects of
          sense-perception. But this line of argument has little to do with
          the present question.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Accordingly we
          must go back to the divisions of the Cynic philosophy. For the
          Cynics also seem to have thought that there were two branches of
          philosophy, as did Aristotle and Plato, namely speculative and
          practical, evidently because they had observed and understood that
          man is by nature suited both to action and to the pursuit of
          knowledge. And though they avoided the study of natural philosophy,
          that does not affect the argument. For Socrates and many others
          also, as we know, devoted themselves to speculation, but it was
          solely for practical ends. For they thought that even
          self-knowledge meant learning precisely what must be assigned to
          the soul, and what to the body. And to the soul they naturally
          assigned supremacy, and to the body subjection. This seems to be
          the reason why they practised virtue, self-control, modesty and
          freedom, and why they shunned all forms of envy, cowardice and
          superstition. But this, you will say, is not the view that we hold
          about them, for we are to think that they were not in earnest, and
          that they hazarded what is most precious<a id="noteref_62" name=
          "noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> in
          thus despising the body; as Socrates did when he declared, and
          rightly, that philosophy is a preparation for death.<a id=
          "noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> And
          since this was the aim that the Cynics pursued daily, we need not
          emulate them any more than the others, but we are to think them
          miserable beings and altogether foolish. But why was it that they
          endured those hardships? Surely not from ostentation, as you
          declared. For how could they win applause from other men by eating
          raw meat? Certainly you yourself do not applaud them for this. At
          any rate, when you imitate one of those Cynics by carrying a staff
          and wearing your hair long, as it is shown in their pictures, do
          you think that you thereby gain a reputation with the crowd, though
          you do not yourself think those habits worthy of admiration? One or
          two, indeed, used to applaud him in his own day, but more than ten
          times ten thousand had their stomachs turned by nausea and
          loathing, and went fasting until their attendants revived them with
          perfumes and myrrh and cakes. So greatly did that renowned hero
          shock them by an act which seems absurd to men)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(though, by the
          gods, it was not ignoble, if one should explain it according to the
          intention of Diogenes. For just as Socrates said of himself that he
          embraced the life of cross-examining because he believed that he
          could perform his service to the god only by examining in all its
          bearings the meaning of the oracle that had been uttered concerning
          him, so I think Diogenes also, because he was convinced that
          philosophy was ordained by the Pythian oracle, believed that he
          ought to test everything by facts and not be influenced by the
          opinions of others, which may be true and may be false. Accordingly
          Diogenes did not think that every statement of Pythagoras, or any
          man like Pythagoras, was necessarily true. For he held that God and
          no human being is the founder of philosophy. And pray what, you
          will say, has this to do with the eating of octopus? I will tell
          you.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(To eat meat
          some regard as natural to man, while others think that to follow
          this practice is not at all appropriate for man, and this question
          has been much debated. And if you are willing to make the effort,
          you can see with your own eyes swarms of books on the subject.
          These Diogenes thought it his duty to refute. At any rate his own
          view was as follows. If one can eat meat without taking too much
          trouble to prepare it, as can all other animals to whom nature has
          assigned this diet, and can do it without harm or discomfort, or
          rather with actual benefit to the body, then he thought that eating
          meat is entirely in accordance with nature. But if harm came of it,
          then he apparently thought that the practice is not appropriate for
          man, and that he must abstain from it by all means. Here then you
          have a theory on this question, though perhaps it is too
          far-fetched: but here is another more akin to Cynicism, only I must
          first describe more clearly the end and aim of that
          philosophy.)</p>

          emotion they regard as the end and aim; and this is equivalent to
          becoming a god. Now perhaps Diogenes observed that in the case of
          all other foods he himself had no particular sensations, and that
          only raw meat gave him indigestion and nausea, and took this for a
          proof that he was enslaved to vain opinion rather than reason; for
          flesh is none the less flesh, even though you cook it any number of
          times or season it with any number of sauces. This, I say, was why
          he thought he ought to rid and free himself altogether of this

          state also? You can give me no other answer than that this has
          become a custom and a habit with us. For surely we cannot say that
          before meat is cooked it is disgusting and that by being cooked it
          becomes purer than it was by nature. What then was it right for him
          to do who had been appointed by God like a general in command to do
          away with the common currency and to judge all questions by the
          criterion of reason and truth? Ought he to have shut his eyes and
          been so far fettered by this general opinion as to believe that
          flesh by being cooked becomes pure and fit for food, but that when
          it has not been acted upon by fire it is somehow abominable and
          loathsome? Is this the sort of memory you have? Is this your zeal
          for truth? For though you so severely criticised Diogenes the
          vain-glorious, as you call him—though I call him the most zealous

          recognise, I suppose, the words of the Galilaeans. I almost omitted
          to say that all men who live near the sea, and even some who live
          at a distance from it, swallow down sea-urchins, oysters and in
          general everything of the kind without even heating them. And then
          you think they are enviable, whereas you regard Diogenes as
          contemptible and disgusting, and you do not perceive that those
          shell-fish are flesh just as much as what he ate? Except perhaps
          that differ in so far as the octopus is soft and shell-fish are
          harder. At any rate the octopus is bloodless, like hard-shelled
          fish, but the latter too are animate things like the octopus. At
          least they feel pleasure and pain, which is the peculiar
          characteristic of animate things. And here we must not be put out
          by Plato's theory<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href=
          "#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> that
          plants also are animated by soul. But it is now, I think, evident
          to those who are in any way able to follow an argument, that what
          the excellent Diogenes did was not out of the way or irregular or
          contrary to our habits, that is if we do not in such cases apply
          the criterion of hardness and softness, but judge rather by the
          pleasure or distaste of the palate. And so it is not after all the
          eating of raw food that disgusts you, since you do the like, not
          only in the case of bloodless animals but also of those that have
          blood. But perhaps there is also this difference between you and
          Diogenes, that he thought he ought to eat such food just as it was
          and in the natural state, whereas you think you must first prepare
          it with salt and many other things to make it agreeable and so do
          violence to nature. I have now said enough on this subject.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now the end and
          aim of the Cynic philosophy, as indeed of every philosophy, is
          happiness, but happiness that consists in living according to
          nature and not according to the opinions of the multitude. For
          plants too are considered to do well, and indeed all animals also,
          when without hindrance each attains the end designed for it by
          nature. Nay, even among the gods this is the definition of
          happiness, that their state should be according to their nature,
          and that they should be independent. And so too in the case of
          human beings we must not be busy about happiness as if it were
          hidden away outside ourselves. Neither the eagle nor the plane tree
          nor anything else that has life, whether plant or animal, vainly
          troubles itself about wings or leaves of gold or that its shoots
          may be of silver or its stings and spurs of iron, or rather of
          adamant; but where nature in the beginning has adorned them with
          such things, they consider that, if only they are strong and
          serviceable for speed or defence, they themselves are fortunate and
          well provided. Then is it not absurd when a human being tries to
          find happiness somewhere outside himself, and thinks that wealth
          and birth and the influence of friends, and generally speaking
          everything of that sort is of the utmost importance? If however
          nature had bestowed on us only what she has bestowed on other
          animals, I mean the possession of bodies and souls like theirs, so
          that we need concern ourselves with nothing beyond, then it would
          suffice for us, as for all other animals, to content ourselves with
          physical advantages, and to pursue happiness within this field. But
          in us has been implanted a soul that in no way resembles other
          animals; and whether it be different in essence, or not different
          in essence but superior in its activity only, just as, I suppose,
          pure gold is superior to gold alloyed with sand,—for some people
          hold this theory to be true of the soul,—at any rate we surely know
          that we are more intelligent than other animals. For according to
          the myth in the Protagoras,<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74"
          href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> nature
          dealt with them very generously and bountifully, like a mother, but
          to compensate for all this, mind was bestowed on us by Zeus.
          Therefore in our minds, in the best and noblest part of us, we must
          say that happiness resides.)</p>

          it stronger than it was by nature. He allowed himself to act only
          as the light of reason shows us that we ought to act; and the
          perturbations that attack the soul and are derived from the body,
          to which this envelope of ours often constrains us for its sake to
          pay too much attention, he did not take into account at all. Thus
          by means of this discipline the man made his body more vigorous, I
          believe, than that of any who have contended for the prize of a
          crown in the games: and his soul was so disposed that he was happy

          crowd of people among whom was Diogenes, a certain youth made an
          unseemly noise, Diogenes struck him with his staff and said
          <span class="tei tei-q">“And so, vile wretch, though you have done
          nothing that would give you the right to take such liberties in
          public, you are beginning here and before us to show your scorn of
          opinion?”</span> So convinced was he that a man ought to subdue
          pleasure and passion before he proceeds to the final encounter of
          all<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href=

          strips to wrestle with those opinions which to the multitude are
          the cause of evils innumerable.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Do you not know
          how people lure away the young from philosophy by continually
          uttering now one slander and then another against all the
          philosophers in turn? The genuine disciples of Pythagoras and Plato
          and Aristotle are called sorcerers and sophists and conceited and
          quacks. If here and there among the Cynics one is really virtuous
          he is regarded with pity. For instance I remember that once my
          tutor said to me when he saw my fellow-pupil Iphicles with his hair
          unkempt and his clothes in tatters on his chest and wearing a
          wretched cloak in severe winter weather: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What evil genius can have plunged him into this sad
          state which makes not only him pitiable but even more so his
          parents who reared him with care and gave him the best education
          they could! And now he goes about in this condition, neglecting
          everything and no better than a beggar!”</span> At the time I
          answered him with some pleasantry or other. But I assure you that
          the multitude hold these views about genuine Cynics also. And that
          is not so dreadful, but do you see that they persuade them to love
          wealth, to hate poverty, to minister to the belly, to endure any
          toil for the body's sake, to fatten that prison of the soul, to
          keep up an expensive table, never to sleep alone at night,<a id=

          provided only that they do all this in the dark and are not found
          out? Is not this worse than Tartarus? Is it not better to sink
          beneath Charybdis and Cocytus or ten thousand fathoms deep in the
          earth<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=
          "#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          to fall into a life like this, enslaved to lust and appetite, and
          not even to these simply and openly, like the beasts, but to take
          pains so that when we act thus we may be hidden under cover of
          darkness? And yet much better is it to refrain altogether from all
          this! And if that be difficult the rules of Diogenes and Crates on
          these matters are not to be despised: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Fasting quenches desire, and if you cannot fast, hang
          yourself.”</span><a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href=

          not know that those great men lived as they did in order to
          introduce among men the way of plain living? "For," says Diogenes,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it is not among men who live on bread that
          you will find tyrants, but among those who eat costly
          dinners.”</span> Moreover Crates wrote a hymn to Plain Living:)</p>

          the Cynic be like Oenomaus shameless or impudent, or a scorner of
          everything human and divine, but reverent towards sacred things,
          like Diogenes. For he obeyed the Pythian oracle nor did he repent
          of his obedience. But if anyone supposes that because he did not
          visit the temples or worship statues or altars this is a sign of
          impiety, he does not think rightly. For Diogenes possessed nothing
          that is usually offered, incense or libations or money to buy them
          with. But if he held right opinions about the gods, that in itself
          was enough. For he worshipped them with his whole soul, thus
          offering them as I think the most precious of his possessions, the
          dedication of his soul through his thoughts. Let not the Cynic be
          shameless, but led by reason let him first make subservient to
          himself the emotional part of his soul so that he may entirely do
          away with it and not even be aware that he is superior to
          pleasures. For it is nobler to attain to this, I mean to complete
          ignorance whether one has any such emotions. And this comes to us
          only through training. And that none may think I say this at random

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But let me go
          back to what I said before, that he who is entering on the career
          of a Cynic ought first censure severely and cross-examine himself,
          and without any self-flattery ask himself the following questions
          in precise terms: whether he enjoys expensive food; whether he
          cannot do without a soft bed; whether he is the slave of rewards
          and the opinion of men; whether it is his ambition to attract
          public notice and even though that be an empty honour<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> he
          still thinks it worth while. Nevertheless he must not let himself
          drift with the current of the mob or touch vulgar pleasure even
          with the tip of his finger, as the saying is, until he has
          succeeded in trampling on it; then and not before he may permit
          himself to dip into that sort of thing if it come his way. For
          instance I am told that bulls which are weaker than the rest
          separate themselves from the herd and pasture alone while they
          store up their strength in every part of their bodies by degrees,
          until they rejoin the herd in good condition, and then they
          challenge its leaders to contend with them, in confidence that they
          are more fit to take the lead. Therefore let him who wishes to be a
          Cynic philosopher not adopt merely their long cloak or wallet or
          staff or their way of wearing the hair, as though he were like a
          man walking unshaved and illiterate in a village that lacked
          barbers' shops and schools, but let him consider that reason rather
          than a staff and a certain plan of life rather than a wallet are
          the mintmarks of the Cynic philosophy. And freedom of speech he
          must not employ until he have first proved how much he is worth, as
          I believe was the case with Crates and Diogenes. For they were so
          far from bearing with a bad grace any threat of fortune, whether
          one call such threats caprice or wanton insult, that once when he
          had been captured by pirates Diogenes joked with them; as for
          Crates he gave his property to the state, and being physically
          deformed he made fun of his own lame leg and hunched shoulders. But
          when his friends gave an entertainment he used to go, whether
          invited or not,<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href=
          "#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          would reconcile his nearest friends if he learned that they had
          quarrelled. He used to reprove them not harshly but with a charming
          manner and not so as to seem to persecute those whom he wished to
          reform, but as though he wished to be of use both to them and to
          the bystanders.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Yet this was
          not the chief end and aim of those Cynics, but as I said their main

          they comprehended that man is by nature a social and political
          animal; and so they aided their fellow-citizens, not only by
          practising but by preaching as well. Then let him who wishes to be
          a Cynic, earnest and sincere, first take himself in hand like
          Diogenes and Crates, and expel from his own soul and from every
          part of it all passions and desires, and entrust all his affairs to
          reason and intelligence and steer his course by them. For this in
          my opinion was the sum and substance of the philosophy of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And if Diogenes
          did sometimes visit a courtesan—though even this happened only once
          perhaps or not even once—let him who would be a Cynic first satisfy
          us that he is, like Diogenes, a man of solid worth, and then if he
          see fit to do that sort of thing openly and in the sight of all
          men, we shall not reproach him with it or accuse him. First however
          we must see him display the ability to learn and the quick wit of
          Diogenes, and in all other relations he must show the same
          independence, self-sufficiency, justice, moderation, piety,
          gratitude, and the same extreme carefulness not to act at random or
          without a purpose or irrationally. For these too are characteristic
          of the philosophy of Diogenes. Then let him trample on
          vaingloriousness, let him ridicule those who though they conceal in
          darkness the necessary functions of our nature—for instance the
          secretion of what is superfluous—yet in the centre of the
          market-place and of our cities carry on practices that are most
          brutal and by no means akin to our nature, for instance robbery of
          money, false accusations, unjust indictments, and the pursuit of
          other rascally business of the same sort. On the other hand when
          Diogenes made unseemly noises or obeyed the call of nature or did
          anything else of that sort in the market-place, as they say he did,
          he did so because he was trying to trample on the conceit of the
          men I have just mentioned, and to teach them that their practices
          were far more sordid and insupportable than his own. For what he
          did was in accordance with the nature of all of us, but theirs
          accorded with no man's real nature, one may say, but were all due
          to moral depravity.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(In our own day,
          however, the imitators of Diogenes have chosen only what is easiest
          and least burdensome and have failed to see his nobler side. And as
          for you, in your desire to be more dignified than those early
          Cynics you have strayed so far from Diogenes' plan of life that you
          thought him an object of pity. But if you did not believe all this
          that I say about a man whom all the Greeks in the generation of
          Plato and Aristotle admired next to Socrates and Pythagoras, a man
          whose pupil was the teacher of the most modest and most wise
          Zeno,—and it is not likely that they were all deceived about a man
          as contemptible as you make him out to be in your travesty,—well,
          in that case, my dear sir, perhaps you might have studied his
          character more carefully and you would have progressed further in
          your knowledge of the man. Was there, I ask, a single Greek who was
          not amazed by the endurance of Diogenes and by his perseverance,
          which had in it a truly royal greatness of soul? The man used to

          public affairs, you would know how much Alexander is said to have

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Seventh
          Oration is directed against the Cynic Heracleios, who had ventured
          to recite before an audience when Julian was present a myth or
          allegory in which the gods were irreverently handled. Julian raises
          the question whether fables and myths are suitable for a Cynic
          discourse. He names the regular divisions of philosophy and decides
          that the use of myths may properly be allowed only to ethical
          philosophers and writers on theology: that myth is intended always
          as a means of religious teaching and should be addressed to
          children and those whose intellect does not allow them to envisage
          the truth without some such assistance. In Sallust's treatise
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the
          Gods and the World</span></span> he gives much the same account of
          the proper function of myths and divides them into five species,
          giving examples of each. <span class="tei tei-q">“To wish to teach
          the whole truth about the gods to all produces contempt in the
          foolish, because they cannot understand, and lack of zeal in the
          good; whereas to conceal the truth by myths prevents the contempt
          of the foolish and compels the good to practise
          philosophy.”</span><a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href=
          "#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> This
          is precisely the opinion of Julian as expressed <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh
          Orations. Though both Julian and Sallust explain the myths away
          they are never rationalistic, and never offer the least excuse for
          scepticism. Julian's explanation of the Semele myth,<a id=
          "noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> which
          makes Semele an inspired prophetess and not the mother of Dionysus,
          tends to the greater glory of the god. The conclusion is that
          Heracleios should not have used myth at all, but in any case he
          used the wrong sort and wrote in the wrong spirit. He should have
          used such a myth as that composed by Prodicus the sophist on the
          Choice of Heracles at the Crossroads, an allegory which is more
          than once cited by Julian and was a favourite illustration in later
          Greek literature.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href=
          "#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To show
          Heraclius what he might have written with propriety Julian adds a
          parable of his own modelled on that of Prodicus. In this he himself
          plays the part of a second Heracles, and takes the opportunity to
          vilify Constantius and point out his own mission of reformer and
          restorer of order and religion to the Empire. Throughout the
          parable there are striking resemblances with the First Oration of
          Dio Chrysostom, and Asmus<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115"
          href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> has
          made a detailed comparison of the two writers to prove that Julian
          wrote with Dio before him. In many of these parallels both Julian
          and Dio can be traced to a common classical source, usually Plato,
          but there is no doubt that Julian was thoroughly familiar with
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name=
          "Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the work of Dio and
          often used the same illustrations. Themistius<a id="noteref_116"
          name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a>
          however uses the Prodicus myth in much the same words as Dio, and
          it is imitated also by Maximus of Tyre.<a id="noteref_117" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In conclusion
          Julian praises the earlier Cynics and criticises the later, in much

          any profitable fashion. For a moment my impulse was to rise and
          break up the meeting. But though I had to listen as one does when

          brief fraction of a day even a babbling Cynic! It is not the first
          time that thou hast had to hear the gods blasphemed! Our state is
          not so well governed, our private life is not so virtuous, in a
          word we are not so favoured by fortune that we can keep our ears
          pure or at any rate our eyes at least undefiled by the many and
          various impieties of this iron race. And now as though we had not
          enough of such vileness this Cynic fills our ears with his
          blasphemies, and has uttered the name of the highest of the gods in
          such wise as would he had never spoken nor I heard! But since he
          has done this, come, let me in your presence try to teach him this
          lesson; first that it is more becoming for a Cynic to write
          discourses than myths; secondly, what sort of adaptations of the
          myths he ought to make, if indeed philosophy really needs mythology
          at all; and finally I shall have a few words to say about reverence
          for the gods. For it is with this aim that I appear before you, I
          who have no talent for writing and who have hitherto avoided
          addressing the general public, as I have avoided all else that is
          tedious and sophistical. But perhaps it is not unsuitable for me to
          say and for you to hear a few words about myth in general as a sort
          of genealogy of that kind of writing.)</p>

          no more discover where myth was originally invented and who was the
          first to compose fiction in a plausible manner for the benefit or

          who was the first man that sneezed or the first horse that neighed.

          archers and the lighter sort of weapons in India, Crete and
          Caria—since the customs of the people were I suppose adapted to the
          nature of the country,—just so we may assume about other things as
          well, that where anything is highly prized by a nation it was first
          discovered by that nation rather than by any other. On this
          assumption then it seems likely that myth was originally the
          invention of men given to pastoral pursuits, and from that day to
          this the making of myths is still peculiarly cultivated by them,
          just as they first invented instruments of music, the flute and the
          lyre, for their pleasure and entertainment. For just as it is the
          nature of birds to fly and of fish to swim and of stags to run, and
          hence they need not be taught to do so; and even if one bind or
          imprison these animals they try none the less to use those special
          parts of themselves for the purpose for which they know they are
          naturally adapted; even so I think the human race whose soul is no
          other than reason and knowledge imprisoned so to speak in the
          body—the philosophers call it a potentiality—even so I say the
          human race inclines to learning, research and study, as of all
          tasks most congenial to it. And when a kindly god without delay
          looses a man's fetters and brings that potentiality into activity,
          then on the instant knowledge is his: whereas in those who are
          still imprisoned false opinion instead of true is implanted, just
          as, I think, Ixion is said to have embraced a sort of cloud instead
          of the goddess.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href=

          monstrous births, mere phantoms and shadows so to speak of true
          science. And thus instead of genuine science they profess false
          doctrines, and are very zealous in learning and teaching such
          doctrines, as though forsooth they were something useful and
          admirable. But if I am bound to say something in defence of those
          who originally invented myths, I think they wrote them for childish
          souls: and I liken them to nurses who hand toys to the hands of
          children when they are irritated by teething, in order to ease
          their suffering: so those mythologists wrote for the feeble soul
          whose wings are just beginning to sprout, and who, though still
          incapable of being taught the truth, is yearning for further
          knowledge, and they poured in a stream of myths like men who water
          a thirsty field, so as to soothe their irritation and pangs.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Then when the
          myth was gaining ground and coming into favour in Greece, poets
          developed from it the fable with a moral, which differs from the
          myth in that the latter is addressed to children and the former to
          men, and is designed not merely to entertain them but conveys moral
          exhortation besides. For the man who employs fable aims at moral
          exhortation and instruction, though he conceals his aim and takes
          care not to speak openly, for fear of alienating his hearers.
          Hesiod, for instance, seems to have written with this in view. And
          after him Archilochus often employed myths,<a id="noteref_133"

          adorning and as it were seasoning his poetry with them, probably
          because he saw that his subject matter needed something of this
          sort to make it attractive, and he well knew that poetry without
          myth is merely versification<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134"

          lacks, one may say, its essential characteristic, and so ceases to
          be poetry at all. Therefore he culled these sweets from the Muse of
          Poetry and offered them to his readers, in order that he might not
          be ranked merely as a writer of satire but might be counted a
          poet.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But the Homer
          of myths, or their Thucydides, or Plato, or whatever we must call
          him, was Aesop of Samos, who was a slave by the accident of birth
          rather than by temperament, and he proved his sagacity by this very
          use of fable. For since the law did not allow him freedom of
          speech, he had no resource but to shadow forth his wise counsels
          and trick them out with charms and graces and so serve them up to
          his hearers. Just so, I think, physicians who are free-born men
          prescribe what is necessary, but when a man happens to be a slave
          by birth and a physician by profession, he is forced to take pains
          to flatter and cure his master at the same time. Now if our Cynic
          also is subject to this sort of slavery, let him recite myths, let
          him write them, and let everyone else under the sun leave to him
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rôle</span></span> of mythologist. But since
          he asserts that he alone is free, I do not know what need he has of
          myths. Does he need to temper the harshness and severity of his
          advice with sweetness and charm, so that he may at once benefit
          mankind and avoid being harmed by one whom he has benefited? Nay,
          that is too much like a slave. Moreover, would any man be better
          taught by not hearing facts as they really are, or called by their
          real names, like the comic poet who calls a spade a spade?<a id=

          worthy to be called Pan or Zeus, as though we should ascribe to
          those gods our human understanding? And yet if indeed this were
          possible it would have been better to give the men their own names.
          Would it not have been better to speak of them thus and to bestow
          on them human names, or rather not bestow, for those that our
          parents gave us were enough? Well then if it is neither easier to
          learn by means of fiction, nor appropriate for the Cynic to invent
          that sort of thing at all, why did we not spare that wasteful

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But perhaps you
          will say that though reason asserts that the Cynic, who alone of
          men can claim to be free, ought not to invent and compose lying
          fictions instead of the unvarnished truth and then recite these in
          public assemblies, nevertheless the custom began with Diogenes and
          Crates, and has been maintained from that time by all Cynics. My
          answer is that nowhere will you find a single example of such a
          custom. For the moment I do not insist on the fact that it in no
          wise becomes a Cynic who must <span class="tei tei-q">“give a new
          stamp to the common currency”</span><a id="noteref_146" name=

          pay any attention to custom, but only to pure reason, and he ought
          to discover within himself what is right for him to do and not
          learn it from without. And do not be misled by the fact that
          Antisthenes the disciple of Socrates, and Xenophon too, sometimes
          expressed themselves by means of myths; for I shall have something
          to say to you on this point in a moment. But now in the Muses' name
          answer me this question about the Cynic philosophy. Are we to think
          it a sort of madness, a method of life not suitable for a human
          being, but rather a brutal attitude of mind which recks naught of
          the beautiful, the honourable, or the good? For Oenomaus<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> would
          make many people hold this view of it. If you had taken any trouble
          to study the subject, you would have learned this from that Cynic's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Direct Inspiration of Oracles”</span> and
          his work <span class="tei tei-q">“Against the Oracles,”</span> in
          short from everything that he wrote. This then is his aim, to do
          away with all reverence for the gods, to bring dishonour on all
          human wisdom, to trample on all law that can be identified with
          honour and justice, and more than this, to trample on those laws
          which have been as it were engraved on our souls by the gods, and
          have impelled us all to believe without teaching that the divine
          exists, and to direct our eyes to it and to yearn towards it: for
          our souls are disposed towards it as eyes towards the light.
          Furthermore, suppose that one should discard also that second law
          which is sanctified both by nature and by God, I mean the law that
          bids us keep our hands altogether and utterly from the property of
          others and permits us neither by word or deed or in the inmost and
          secret activities of our souls to confound such distinctions, since
          the law is our guide to the most perfect justice—is not this
          conduct worthy of pit?<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href=

          that penalty is too light for such crimes, but put to death by
          stoning? For tell me, in Heaven's name, how are such men less
          criminal than bandits who infest lonely places and haunt the coasts
          in order to despoil navigators? Because, as people say, they

          pleases. But if he do as the god enjoined on Diogenes, and first
          <span class="tei tei-q">“give a new stamp to the common
          currency,”</span> then devote himself to the advice uttered earlier
          by the god, the precept <span class="tei tei-q">“Know
          Thyself,”</span> which Diogenes and Crates evidently followed in
          their actual practice, then I say that this is wholly worthy of one
          who desires to be a leader and a philosopher. For surely we know
          what the god meant? He enjoined on Diogenes to despise the opinion
          of the crowd and to give a new stamp, not to truth, but to the
          common currency. Now to which of these categories shall we assign
          self-knowledge? Can we call it common currency? Shall we not rather
          say that it is the very summary of truth, and by the injunction
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Know Thyself”</span> we are told the way
          in which we must <span class="tei tei-q">“give a new stamp to the
          common currency”</span>? For just as one who pays no regard
          whatever to conventional opinions but goes straight for the truth
          will not decide his own conduct by those opinions but by actual
          facts, so I think he who knows himself will know accurately, not
          the opinion of others about him, but what he is in reality. It
          follows then, does it not? that the Pythian god speaks the truth,
          and moreover that Diogenes was clearly convinced of this since he
          obeyed the god and so became, instead of an exile, I will not say
          greater than the King of Persia, but according to the tradition
          handed down actually an object of envy to the man<a id=

          had broken the power of Persia and was rivalling the exploits of
          Heracles and ambitious to surpass Achilles. Then let us judge of
          the attitude of Diogenes towards gods and men, not from the
          discourses of Oenomaus or the tragedies of Philiscus—who by
          ascribing their authorship to Diogenes grossly slandered that
          sacred personage—but let us, I say, judge him by his deeds.)</p>

          other motive than that of doing honour to the god. He was not, you

          such signs from Zeus over and over again, without being awestruck!
          Yet for all that I feel awe of the gods, I love, I revere, I

          convinced was he that it was his duty to visit the temples of the

          which he wrote to Archidamus? Nay, not only in words but in deeds
          also did Diogenes show his reverence for the gods. For he preferred
          to live in Athens, but when the divine command had sent him away to
          Corinth, even after he had been set free by the man who had bought
          him, he did not think he ought to leave that city. For he believed
          that the gods took care of him, and that he had been sent to
          Corinth, not at random or by some accident, but by the gods
          themselves for some purpose. He saw that Corinth was more luxurious
          than Athens, and stood in need of a more severe and courageous
          reformer.)</p>

          I believe Crates recognized, and so with that piety which was his
          only possession he himself used to honour the gods with praises,
          and moreover taught others not to honour expensive offerings more
          than piety in the sacred ceremonies. This then was the attitude of
          both those Cynics towards the gods but they did not crowd audiences
          together to hear them, nor did they entertain their friends with
          similes and myths, like the wise men of to-day. For as Euripides

          and the dishonest man, he says, have any use for a mysterious and
          allusive style. Now what was the manner of their intercourse with
          men? Deeds with them came before words, and if they honoured
          poverty they themselves seem first to have scorned inherited
          wealth; if they cultivated modesty, they themselves first practised
          plain living in every respect; if they tried to expel from the
          lives of other men the element of theatrical display and arrogance,
          they themselves first set the example by living in the open market
          places and the temple precincts, and they opposed luxury by their
          own practice before they did so in words; nor did they shout aloud
          but proved by their actions that a man may rule as the equal of
          Zeus if he needs nothing or very little and so is not hampered by
          his body; and they reproved sinners during the lifetime of those
          who had offended but did not speak ill of the dead; for when men
          are dead even their enemies, at least the more moderate, make peace
          with the departed. But the genuine Cynic has no enemy, even though
          men strike his feeble body or drag his name in the mire, or slander
          and speak ill of him, because enmity is felt only towards an
          opponent, but that which is above personal rivalry is usually loved
          and respected. But if anyone is hostile to a Cynic, as indeed many
          are even to the gods, he is not that Cynic's enemy, since he cannot
          injure him; rather he inflicts on himself the most terrible
          punishment of all, namely ignorance of one who is nobler than
          himself; and so he is deserted and bereft of the other's
          protection.)</p>

          present task were to write about the Cynic philosophy, I could add
          many details about the Cynics, not less important than what I have
          said already. But not to interrupt my main theme, I will now
          consider in due course the question what kind of myths ought to be
          invented. But perhaps another inquiry should precede this attempt,
          I mean to what branch of philosophy the composition of myths is
          appropriate. For we see that many philosophers and theologians too
          have employed it, Orpheus for instance, the most ancient of all the
          inspired philosophers, and many besides of those that came after
          him. Nay what is more, Xenophon as we know and Antisthenes and
          Plato often introduced myths, so that it is obvious that even if
          the use of myth be not appropriate for the Cynic, still it may be
          so for some other type of philosopher.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I must first
          then say a few words about the subdivisions or instruments of
          philosophy. It does not make much difference in which of two ways
          one reckons logic, whether with practical or natural philosophy,
          since it is equally necessary to both these branches. But I will
          consider these as three separate branches and assign to each one
          three subdivisions. Natural philosophy consists of theology,
          mathematics, and thirdly the study of this world of generation and
          decay and things that though imperishable are nevertheless matter,
          and deals with their essential nature and their substance in each
          case. Practical philosophy again consists of ethics in so far as it
          deals with the individual man, economics when it deals with the
          household as a unit, politics when it deals with the state. Logic,
          again, is demonstrative in so far as it deals with the truth of
          principles; polemic when it deals with general opinions; eristic
          when it deals with opinions that only seem probabilities. These
          then are the divisions of philosophy, if I mistake not. Though
          indeed it would not be surprising that a mere soldier should be
          none too exact in these matters or not have them at his fingers'
          ends, seeing that I speak less from book-knowledge than from
          observation and experience. For that matter you can yourselves bear
          me witness thereto, if you count up how few days have elapsed
          between the lecture that we lately heard and to-day, and moreover
          the number of affairs with which they have been filled for me. But
          as I said if I have omitted anything—though I do not think I
          have—still if anyone can make my classification more complete he
          will be <span class="tei tei-q">“no enemy but my

          branches of philosophy, logic has no concern with the composition
          of myths; nor has mathematics, the sub-division of natural
          philosophy; but they may be employed, if at all, by that department
          of practical philosophy which deals with the individual man, and by
          that department of theology which has to do with initiation and the
          Mysteries. For nature loves to hide her secrets,<a id="noteref_176"

          she does not suffer the hidden truth about the essential nature of
          the gods to be flung in naked words to the ears of the profane. Now
          there are certain characteristics of ours that derive benefit from
          that occult and unknown nature, which nourishes not our souls alone
          but our bodies also, and brings us into the presence of the gods,
          and this I think often comes about by means of myths; when through
          riddles and the dramatic setting of myths that knowledge is
          insinuated into the ears of the multitude who cannot receive divine
          truths in their purest form.)</p>

          evident what branch and what sort of philosophy may properly on
          occasion employ myths. And to support my argument I call to witness
          the authority of those philosophers who were the first to use
          myths. Plato for instance in his theological descriptions of life
          in Hades often uses myths, and the son<a id="noteref_178" name=
          "noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class=

          Calliope before him. And when Antisthenes and Xenophon and Plato
          himself discuss certain ethical theories they use myths as one of
          the ingredients, and not casually but of set purpose. Now if you
          too wished to use myths you ought to have imitated these
          philosophers, and instead of Heracles you should have introduced
          the name of Perseus or Theseus, let us say, and have written in the
          style of Antisthenes; and in place of the dramatic setting used by

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And now to
          confine myself to what is lawful for us, both for me to say and for
          you to hear. Every discourse that is uttered consists of language
          and the thought to be expressed. Now a myth is a sort of discourse
          and so it will consist of these two. Let us consider them
          separately. In every discourse the thought is of two kinds, either
          simple or expressed in figures of speech; and there are many
          examples of both kinds. The one is simple and admits of no variety,
          but that which is embellished with figures has in itself many
          possibilities of variation with all of which you are yourself
          familiar if you have ever studied rhetoric; and most of these
          figures of thought are suited to myth. However I need not now
          discuss all or indeed many of them, but only two, that in which the
          thought is dignified and that in which it is paradoxical. The same
          rules apply also to diction. For this is given a certain shape and
          form by those who do not express themselves carelessly or sweep in
          the refuse of language from the highways like a winter torrent. And
          now to consider these two types. When we invent myths about sacred
          things our language must be wholly dignified and the diction must
          be as far as possible sober, beautiful, and entirely appropriate to
          the gods; there must be nothing in it base or slanderous or
          impious, for fear we should lead the common people into this sort
          of sacrilegious rashness; or rather for fear we should ourselves
          anticipate the common people in displaying impiety towards the
          gods. Therefore there must be no incongruous element in diction
          thus employed, but all must be dignified, beautiful, splendid,
          divine, pure, and as far as possible in conformity with the
          essential nature of the gods. But as regards the thought, the
          incongruous may be admitted, so that under the guidance of the gods
          men may be inspired to search out and study the hidden meaning,
          though they must not ask for any hint of the truth from others, but
          must acquire their knowledge from what is said in the myth
          itself.<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href=
          "#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a> For
          instance I have heard many people say that Dionysus was a mortal
          man because he was born of Semele, and that he became a god through
          his knowledge of theurgy and the Mysteries, and like our lord
          Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his
          father Zeus. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, my good sir,”</span>
          said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you not perceive that the myth
          is obviously an allegory?”</span> For in what sense do we regard
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“birth”</span> of Heracles, yes, and of
          Dionysus as well, since in their case birth has superior and
          surpassing and distinctive elements, even though it still falls
          within the limits of human nature, and up to a certain point
          resembles our own? Heracles for instance is said to have been a
          child, even as we are; his divine body grew gradually; we are
          informed that he was instructed by teachers;<a id="noteref_190"
          name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> they
          say that he carried on wars and defeated all his opponents, but for
          all that his body had to endure weariness. And in fact all this did
          in his case occur, but on a scale greater than human. For instance,
          while still in swaddling clothes he strangled the serpents and then
          opposed himself to the very elements of nature, the extremes of
          heat and cold and things the most difficult and hardest to contend
          with, I mean lack of food and loneliness;<a id="noteref_191" name=
          "noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a> and
          then there is his journey over the sea itself in a golden
          cup,<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href=
          "#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a>
          though, by the gods, I do not think it was really a cup, but my
          belief is that he himself walked on the sea as though it were dry
          land.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href=
          "#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> For
          what was impossible to Heracles? Which was there of the so-called
          elements that did not obey his divine and most pure body since they
          were subdued to the creative and perfecting force of his stainless
          and pure intelligence? For him did mighty Zeus, with the aid of
          Athene goddess of Forethought, beget to be the saviour of the
          world, and appointed as his guardian this goddess whom he had
          brought forth whole from the whole of himself; and later on he
          called him to his side through the flame of a thunderbolt, thus
          bidding his son to come to him by the divine signal of the ethereal
          rays of light. Now when we meditate on this, may Heracles be
          gracious to you and to me!)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(As for the
          commonly received legend about the birth of Dionysus, which was in
          fact no birth but a divine manifestation, in what respect was it
          like the birth of men? While he was still in his mother's womb she,
          as the story goes, was beguiled by jealous Hera to entreat her
          lover to visit her as he was wont to visit his spouse. And then her
          frail body could not endure the thunders of Zeus and began to be
          consumed by the lightning. But when everything there was being
          devoured by flames, Zeus bade Hermes snatch Dionysus forth, and he
          cut open his own thigh and sewed the babe therein.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> Then
          in due course when the time was ripe for the child's birth, Zeus in
          the pangs of travail came to the nymphs, and they by their song
          over the thigh <span class="tei tei-q">“Undo the

          brought to light for us the dithyramb. Whereupon the god was driven
          mad by Hera, but the Mother of the Gods healed him of his sickness
          and he straightway became a god. And he had for followers not, like
          Heracles, Lichas for instance or Iolaus or Telamon or Hylas or
          Abderos, but Satyrs, Bacchanals, Pans and a whole host of lesser
          divinities. Do you perceive how much of human there is in this
          generation through the fire of a thunderbolt, that his delivery is
          even more human, and that his deeds, even more than these two that
          we have mentioned, resemble those of human beings? Now why do we
          not set aside all this nonsense and recognise herein first the fact
          that Semele was wise in sacred things? For she was the daughter of
          Phoenician Cadmus, and the god himself bears witness to the wisdom
          of the Phoenicians<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I think then
          that she was the first among the Greeks to perceive that there was
          to be before long a visible manifestation of this god, and that she
          foretold it, and then that, sooner than was fitting, she gave the
          signal for certain of the mystic rites connected with his worship,
          because she had not the patience to wait for the appointed time,
          and thus she was consumed by the fire that fell upon her. But when
          it was the will of Zeus to bestow on all mankind in common a new
          order of things, and to make them pass from the nomadic to a more
          civilised mode of life, Dionysus came from India and revealed
          himself as very god made visible, visiting the cities of men and
          leading with him a great host of beings in some sort divine; and
          everywhere he bestowed on all men in common as the symbol of his
          manifestation the plant of <span class="tei tei-q">“the gentle
          vine”</span>; and since their lives were made more gentle by it the

          they called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction
          that she had made, but also because the god honoured her as having
          been the first prophetess of his advent while it was yet to
          be.)</p>

          Dionysus himself decide about these things, though I do indeed
          implore him to inspire my mind and yours with his own sacred frenzy

          too long uninspired by him have to suffer the fate of Pentheus,
          perhaps even while we are alive, but most certainly after death has
          freed us from the body. For he in whom the abundance of life has
          not been perfected by the essential nature of Dionysus, uniform and
          wholly indivisible as it is in the divisible world and pre-existing
          whole and unmixed in all things, he I say who has not been
          perfected by means of the Bacchic and divine frenzy for the god,
          runs the risk that his life may flow into too many channels, and as
          it flows be torn to shreds, and hence come to naught. But when I
          say <span class="tei tei-q">“flow”</span> or <span class=

          meaning of the words and suppose that I mean a mere trickle of
          water or a thread of linen, but he must understand these words in
          another sense, that used by Plato, Plotinus, Porphyry and the
          inspired Iamblichus. One who does not interpret them thus will
          laugh at them no doubt, but let me assure him that it will be a

          and barbarian put together, yea, I swear it by my lord Helios. But
          again some god or other and no choice of my own has made me rave

          to what led me to say all this. Whenever myths on sacred subjects
          are incongruous in thought, by that very fact they cry aloud, as it
          were, and summon us not to believe them literally but to study and
          track down their hidden meaning. And in such myths the incongruous
          element is even more valuable than the serious and straightforward,
          the more so that when the latter is used there is risk of our
          regarding the gods as exceedingly great and noble and good
          certainly, but still as human beings, whereas when the meaning is
          expressed incongruous there is some hope that men will neglect the
          more obvious sense of the words, and that pure intelligence may
          rise to the comprehension of the distinctive nature of the gods
          that transcends all existing things.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(These then are
          the reasons why that branch of philosophy which is connected with
          initiation and the doctrines of the Mysteries ought by all means to
          be expressed in devout and serious language, while as regards the
          thought the narrative may be expounded in a style that has stranger
          qualities. But one who is inventing tales for the purpose of
          reforming morals and inserts myths therein, does so not for men but
          for those who are children whether in years or intelligence, and
          who on all accounts stand in need of such tales. If, however, you
          took us for children, me, for instance, or Anatolius here, and you
          may reckon with us Memmorius also and Sallust and add if you please
          all the others in due order, then you need a voyage to
          Anticyra.<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href=

          why should one pretend to be polite? Tell me, I ask, in the name of
          the gods, and of myth itself, or rather in the name of Helios the
          King of all the universe, what have you ever accomplished, great or
          small? When did you ever champion one who was resisting oppression
          and had right on his side? When did you ever comfort the mourner
          and teach him by your arguments that death is not an evil either
          for him who has suffered it or for his friends? What youth will
          ever give you the credit for his temperance, and say that you have
          made him show himself sober instead of dissolute, and beautiful not
          merely in body but far more in soul? What strenuous discipline have
          you ever embraced? What have you ever done to make you worthy of
          the staff of Diogenes or still more, by Zeus, of his freedom of
          speech? Do you really think it so great an achievement to carry a
          staff and let your hair grow, and haunt cities and camps uttering
          calumnies against the noblest men, and flattering the vilest? Tell
          me in the name of Zeus and of this audience now present, who are
          disgusted with philosophy because of men of your sort, why was it
          that you visited the late Emperor Constantius in Italy but could
          not travel as far as Gaul? And yet if you had come to me you would
          at any rate have associated with one who was better able to
          comprehend your language. What do you gain by travelling about in
          all directions and wearing out the very mules you ride? Yes, and I
          hear that you wear out the mule drivers as well, and that they
          dread the sight of you Cynics even more than of soldiers. For I am
          told that some of you belabour them more cruelly with your staffs
          than do the soldiers with their swords, so that they are naturally
          more afraid of you. Long ago I gave you a nickname and now I think
          I will write it down. It is <span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> a
          name applied to certain persons by the impious Galilaeans. They are
          for the most part men who by making small sacrifices gain much or
          rather everything from all sources, and in addition secure honour,
          crowds of attendants and flattery. Something like that is your
          method, except perhaps for uttering divine revelations: but this is
          not your custom, though it is ours; for we are wiser than those
          insensate men. And perhaps too there is this difference that you
          have no excuse for levying tribute on specious pretexts as they do;
          which they call <span class="tei tei-q">“alms,”</span> whatever
          that may mean. But in all other respects your habits and theirs are
          very much alike. Like them you have abandoned your country, you
          wander about all over the world, and you gave more trouble than
          they did at my headquarters, and were more insolent. For they were
          at any rate invited to come, but you we tried to drive away. And
          what good have you, or rather, what have the rest of us derived
          from all this? First arrived Asclepiades, then Serenianus, then
          Chytron, then a tall boy with yellow hair—I don't know his
          name—then you, and with you all twice as many more. And now, my
          good sirs, what good has come from your journey? What city or
          individual has had any experience of your alleged freedom of
          speech? Was it not foolish of you to choose in the first place to
          make this journey to an Emperor who did not even wish to set eyes
          on you? And when you had arrived, did you not behave even more
          foolishly and ignorantly and insanely in flattering and barking at
          me in the same breath, and offering me your books, and moreover
          imploring that they should be taken to me? I do not believe that
          any one of you ever visited a philosopher's school as diligently as
          you did my secretary: in fact the entrance to the Palace stood for
          you in place of the Academy and the Lyceum and the Portico.)</p>

          I tell you how you have caused philosophy to be lightly esteemed?
          It is because the most ignorant of the rhetoricians, those whose
          tongues not King Hermes himself could purify, and who could not be
          made wise by Athene herself with the aid of Hermes, having picked
          up their knowledge from their industry in frequenting public

          all rush into Cynicism. They adopt the staff, the cloak, the long
          hair, the ignorance that goes with these, the impudence, the
          insolence, and in a word everything of the sort. They say that they
          are travelling the short and ready road to virtue.<a id=

          would that you were going by the longer! For you would more easily
          arrive by that road than by this of yours. Are you not aware that
          short cuts usually involve one in great difficulties? For just as
          is the case with the public roads, a traveller who is able to take
          a short cut will more easily than other men go all the way round,
          whereas it does not at all follow that he who went round could
          always go the short cut, so too in philosophy the end and the
          beginning are one, namely, to know oneself and to become like the
          gods. That is to say, the first principle is self-knowledge, and
          the end of conduct is the resemblance to the higher powers.)</p>

          with a view to exchanging them, and leave it to him to rate them at
          their proper worth: for he knows that both of them are but earth.
          And the fact that one is scarcer and the other easier to obtain he
          thinks is merely the result of the vanity and ignorance of mankind.
          He will judge of the baseness or nobility of an action, not by the
          applause or blame of men but by its intrinsic nature. He avoids any
          excess in food, and renounces the pleasures of love. When he is
          forced to obey the needs of the body he is not the slave of
          opinion, nor does he wait for a cook and sauces and a savoury
          smell, nor does he ever look about for Phryne or Lais or

          Since, as I was saying, myths ought to be addressed either to those
          who though grown men are children in intelligence, or to those who
          in actual years are mere children, we must take pains to utter in
          them no word that is offensive to gods or men or anything impious,
          as was done recently. And moreover we must in all cases apply
          careful tests to see whether the myth is plausible, closely related
          to the matter discussed and whether what is invented is really a
          myth. Now what you composed lately is not your own myth though you
          boasted that it was. Nay, your myth was an old one and you did but
          adapt it to fresh circumstances, as I believe people are in the
          habit of doing who use tropes and figures of thought. The poet of
          Paros<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href=
          "#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> for
          instance is much given to this style. It seems then that you did
          not even invent your myth, my very clever friend, and that yours
          was an idle boast. Though in fact the thing is done by any nurse
          with an inventive turn. And if the mythical tales of Plutarch had
          ever fallen into your hands you would have failed to observe what a
          difference there is between inventing a myth from the beginning and
          adapting to one's own purpose a myth that already exists. But I
          must not detain you even for a moment or hinder you on your way
          along that short cut to wisdom by making you embark on books that
          are long and hard to read. You have not even heard of the myth by
          Demosthenes which he of the Paeanian deme addressed to the
          Athenians when the Macedonian demanded that the Athenian orators be
          given up. You ought to have invented something of that sort. In
          Heaven's name was it too hard for you to relate some little myth of
          the kind? You will force me too to become a myth-maker.)</p>

          shepherds too he had, both slaves and hired freedmen, neatherds and
          goatherds and grooms for his horses, and many estates withal. Now
          much of all this his father had bequeathed to him, but he had
          himself acquired many times more, being eager to enrich himself
          whether justly or unjustly; for little did he care for gods.
          Several wives he had, and sons and daughters by them, among whom he
          divided his wealth before he died. But he did not teach them how to
          manage it, or how to acquire more if it should fail, or how to
          preserve what they had. For in his ignorance he thought that their
          mere numbers would suffice, nor had he himself any real knowledge
          of that sort of art, since he had not acquired his wealth on any
          rational principle but rather by use and wont, like quack doctors
          who try to cure their patients by relying on their experience only,
          so that many diseases escape them altogether.<a id="noteref_233"

          Accordingly since he thought that a number of sons would suffice to
          preserve his wealth, he took no thought how to make them virtuous.
          But this very thing proved to be the beginning of their iniquitous
          behaviour to one another. For every one of them desired to be as
          wealthy as his father and to possess the whole for himself alone,
          and so attacked the brother that was his neighbour. Now for a time
          they continued to behave thus. And their relatives also shared in
          the folly and ignorance of those sons, since they themselves had
          had no better education. Then ensued a general slaughter, and
          heaven brought the tragic curse<a id="noteref_234" name=

          fulfilment. For <span class="tei tei-q">“by the edge of the sword
          they divided their patrimony”</span> and everything was thrown into
          confusion. The sons demolished the ancestral temples which their
          father before them had despised and had stripped of the votive
          offerings that had been dedicated by many worshippers, but not
          least by his own ancestors. And besides demolishing the temples
          they erected sepulchres<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href=

          on new sites and on the old sites of the temples, as though
          impelled by fate or by an unconscious presentiment that they would
          ere long need many such sepulchres, seeing that they so neglected
          the gods.)</p>

          the insolence of that arrogant and audacious mortal, who by
          forsaking thee brought so many calamities on himself and his race?
          Thinkest thou that, though thou dost not show thine anger and
          resentment against him nor whet thine arrows against his children,
          thou art any less the author of his destruction in that thou dost
          abandon his house to desolation? Nay,”</span> said Zeus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“let us summon the Fates and enquire
          whether any assistance may be given the man.”</span> Forthwith the
          Fates obeyed the call of Zeus. But Helios who was as though
          absorbed in thought and inward debate yet gave constant heed and
          fixed his eyes on Zeus. Then spoke the eldest of the Fates:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O our father, Piety and Justice both
          restrain us. Therefore it is thine to prevail on them also, since
          thou hast ordered us to be subservient to them.”</span> And Zeus
          made answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“Truly they are my daughters,
          and it is meet that I question them. What then have ye to say, ye
          venerable goddesses?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,
          father,”</span> they replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is as

          numerous disasters that had befallen his kinsmen and his cousins,
          and had all but hurled himself into Tartarus, so confounded was he
          by the extent of those calamities. Then Helios of his grace, aided
          Athene, Goddess of Forethought, threw him into a slumber or trance,
          and so diverted him from that purpose. Then when he had waked from
          this he went away into the desert. And there he found a stone and
          rested for a while thereon, debating within himself how he should
          escape evils so many and so vast. For all things now appeared
          grievous to him and for the moment there was no hope anywhere. Then
          Hermes, who had an affinity for him,<a id="noteref_246" name=
          "noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class=

          appeared to him in the guise of a youth of his own age, and
          greeting him kindly said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Follow me, and I
          will guide thee by an easier and smoother road as soon as thou hast
          surmounted this winding and rugged place where thou seest all men
          stumbling and obliged to go back again.”</span> Then the youth set
          out with great circumspection, carrying a sword and shield and
          spear, though as yet his head was bare. Thus relying on Hermes he
          went forward by a road smooth, untrodden and very bright, and
          overhung with fruits and many lovely flowers such as the gods love,
          and with trees also, ivy and laurel and myrtle. Now when Hermes had
          brought him to the foot of a great and lofty mountain, he said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“On the summit of this mountain dwells the
          father of all the gods. Be careful then—for herein lies the
          greatest risk of all<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href=

          worship him with the utmost piety and ask of him whatever thou
          wilt. Thou wilt choose, my child, only what is best.”</span> So
          saying Hermes once more became invisible, though the youth was fain
          to learn from him what he ought to ask from the father of the gods.
          But when he saw that he was no longer at his side he said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The advice though incomplete is good
          nevertheless. Therefore let me by the grace of fortune ask for what
          is best, though I do not as yet see clearly the father of the gods.
          Father Zeus—or whatever name thou dost please that men should call

          me the way that leads upwards to thee. For fairer still methinks
          the region where thou art, if I may judge of the beauty of thy

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(When he had
          uttered this prayer a sort of slumber or ecstasy came over him.
          Then Zeus showed him Helios himself. Awestruck by that vision the
          youth exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“For this and for all thy
          other favours I will dedicate myself to thee, O Father of the
          Gods!”</span> Then he cast his arms about the knees of Helios and
          would not let go his hold but kept entreating him to save him. But
          Helios called Athene and bade her first enquire of him what arms he
          had brought with him. And when she saw his shield and sword and
          spear, she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“But where, my child, is
          thy aegis<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href=
          "#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a> and
          thy helmet?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Even these that I
          have,”</span> he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I procured with
          difficulty. For in the house of my kinsfolk there was none to aid
          one so despised.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Learn
          therefore,”</span> said mighty Helios, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that thou must without fail return thither.”</span>
          Thereupon he entreated him not to send him to earth again but to
          detain him there, since he would never be able to mount upwards a
          second time but would be overwhelmed by the ills of earth. But as
          he wept and implored Helios replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,
          thou art young and not yet initiated. Return therefore to thine own
          people that thou mayst be initiated and thereafter dwell on earth
          in safety. For return thou must, and and cleanse away all impiety
          and invoke me to aid thee, and Athene and the other gods.”</span>
          When Helios had said this the youth remained silent. Then mighty
          Helios led him to a high peak whose upper region was filled with
          light but the lower with the thickest mist imaginable, through
          which, as through water, the light of the rays of King Helios
          penetrated but faintly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
          seest,”</span> said Helios, <span class="tei tei-q">“thy cousin the
          heir?”</span><a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href=
          "#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I see him,”</span> the youth replied.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Again, dost thou see yonder herdsmen and
          shepherds?”</span> The youth answered that he did. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then what thinkest thou of the heir's disposition? And
          what of his shepherds and herdsmen?”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He seems to me,”</span> replied the youth,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to be for the most part asleep, sunk in
          forgetfulness and devoted to pleasure; and of his shepherds a few
          are honest, but most are vicious and brutal. For they devour or
          sell his sheep, and doubly injure their master, in that they not
          only ruin his flocks but besides that they make great gain and
          return him but little thereof, while they declare with loud
          complaint that they are defrauded of their wages. And yet it were
          better that they should demand and obtain their full pay than that
          they should destroy the flock.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Now
          what if I and Athene here,”</span> said Helios, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“obeying the command of Zeus, should appoint thee to
          govern all these, in place of the heir?”</span> Then the youth
          clung to him again and earnestly entreated that he might remain
          there. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not be obstinate in
          disobedience,”</span> said Helios,)</p>

          youth, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do thou, O most mighty Helios, and
          thou, Athene,—and thee too, Father Zeus, do I call to
          witness,—dispose of me as ye will.”</span> Then Hermes suddenly
          appeared once more, and inspired him with greater courage. For now
          he thought that he had found a guide for the journey back, and for
          his sojourn on earth. Then said Athene, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Attend, good youth, that art born of myself and of
          this god, thy noble sire! The most virtuous of the shepherds do not
          please this heir, for flatterers and profligates have made him
          their slave and tool. Thus it is that he is not beloved by the
          good, and is most deeply wronged by those who are supposed to love
          him. Be careful then when thou returnest that he make thee not his
          flatterer rather than his friend. This second warning also do thou
          heed, my son. Yonder man slumbers, and hence he is often deceived,

          the flatterer assume the frankness of a friend and so deceive thee;
          which is as though a smith covered with smoke and cinders should
          come wearing a white garment and with his face painted white, and
          thus induce thee to give him one of thy daughters in

          third warning to thee is this: do thou very zealously keep watch
          over thyself, and reverence us in the first place, and among men
          only him who resembles us, and no one besides. Thou seest how false
          shame and excessive timidity have injured this foolish
          man.”</span>)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Then mighty
          Helios took up the tale and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“When
          thou hast chosen thy friends treat them as friends and do not
          regard them as thy servants and attendants, but let thy conduct
          towards them be generous, candid, and honourable: say not one thing
          about them while thou thinkest another. Thou seest that it was
          treachery to his friends that destroyed this heir. Love thy
          subjects even as we love thee. Prefer our worship to all other
          blessings. For we are thy benefactors and friends and
          preservers.”</span> At these words the youth became calm and showed
          plainly that he was already obedient in all things to the gods.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> said Helios, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“now depart with good hope. For everywhere we shall be
          with thee, even I and Athene and Hermes here, and with us all the
          gods that are on Olympus or in the air or on earth and the whole
          race of gods everywhere, so long as thou art pious towards us and
          loyal to thy friends, and humane towards thy subjects, ruling them
          and guiding them to what is best. But never yield to thy own
          passions or become the slave of theirs. Keep the armour that thou
          hast brought hither, and depart, but first receive from me this
          torch so that even on earth a great light may shine for thee and
          that thou mayst not long for the things of earth. And from fair
          Athene here receive an aegis and helmet. For as thou seest she has
          many, and she gives them to whom she will. And Hermes too will give
          thee a golden wand. Go then thus adorned in full armour over sea
          and land, steadfastly obeying our laws, and let no man or woman or
          kinsman or foreigner persuade thee to neglect our commands. For
          while thou dost abide by them thou wilt be loved and honoured by us
          and respected by our good servants and formidable to the wicked and
          impious. Know that a mortal frame was given to thee that thou
          mightest discharge these duties. For we desire, out of respect for
          thy ancestor to cleanse the house of thy forefathers. Remember
          therefore that thou hast an immortal soul that is our offspring,

          real profit he himself must determine, or rather the ruling gods;

          he says that we ought to believe directly and without proof what we
          are told, I mean what the poets say about the gods. And I have
          brought forward this passage for fear that Socrates may furnish you
          with an excuse,—as I believe he does to many Platonists because of
          his natural tendency to irony,—to slight the doctrine of Plato. For
          it is not Socrates who is speaking here, but Timaeus, who had not
          the least tendency to irony. Though for that matter it is not a
          sound principle to enquire who says a thing and to whom, rather
          than the actual words. But now will you allow me to cite next that
          all-wise Siren, the living image of Hermes the god of eloquence,
          the man dear to Apollo and the Muses?<a id="noteref_280" name=

          he declares that all who raise the question or seek to enquire at
          all whether gods exist ought not to be answered as though they were
          men but to be chastised as wild beasts. And if you had read that
          introductory sentence which was inscribed over the entrance to his
          school, like Plato's, you would most surely know that those who
          entered the Lyceum were warned to be reverent to the gods, to be
          initiated into all the mysteries, to take part in the most sacred
          ceremonies, and to be instructed in knowledge of every kind.)</p>

          of you, my young friend, to think that any tax-gatherer, if only he
          be initiated, can share in the rewards of the just in the next

          this, my young friend, is a very hard saying and, I am persuaded,
          calls for more profound discussion. May the goddesses themselves
          grant us understanding thereof! Though indeed I think that has
          already been bestowed by them. For it is evident that Diogenes was
          not impious, as you aver, but resembled those philosophers whom I
          mentioned a moment ago. For having regard to the circumstances in
          which his lot was cast, and next paying heed to the commands of the
          Pythian god, and knowing that the candidate for initiation must
          first be registered as an Athenian citizen, and if he be not an
          Athenian by birth must first become one by law, it was this he
          avoided, not initiation, because he considered that he was a
          citizen of the world; and moreover such was the greatness of his
          soul that he thought he ought to associate himself with the divine
          nature of all the gods who in common govern the whole universe, and
          not only with those whose functions are limited to certain portions
          of it. And out of reverence for the gods he did not transgress
          their laws, though he trampled on all other opinions and tried to
          give a new stamp to the common currency. And he did not return to
          that servitude from which he had joyfully been released. What
          servitude do I mean? I mean that he would not enslave himself to
          the laws of a single city and submit himself to all that must needs
          befall one who had become an Athenian citizen. For is it likely
          that a man who in order to honour the gods journeyed to Olympia,
          and like Socrates embraced philosophy in obedience to the Pythian
          oracle,—for he says himself that at home and in private he received
          the commands of that oracle and hence came his impulse to
          philosophy<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href=
          "#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a>—is it
          likely I say that such a man would not very gladly have entered the
          temples of the gods but for the fact that he was trying to avoid
          submitting himself to any set of laws and making himself the slave
          of any one constitution? But why, you will say, did he not assign
          this reason, but on the contrary a reason that detracted not a
          little from the dignity of the Mysteries? Perhaps one might bring
          this same reproach against Pythagoras as well, but the reasoning
          would be incorrect. For everything ought not to be told, nay more,
          even of those things that we are permitted to declare, some, it
          seems to me, we ought to refrain from uttering to the vulgar
          crowd.<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a>
          However the explanation in this case is obvious. For since he
          perceived that the man who exhorted him to be initiated neglected
          to regulate his own life aright, though he prided himself on having
          been initiated, Diogenes wished at the same time to reform his
          morals and to teach him that the gods reserve their rewards without
          stint for those whose lives have earned them the right to be
          initiated, even though they have not gone through the ceremony,
          whereas the wicked gain nothing by penetrating within the sacred
          precincts. For this is what the hierophant proclaims, when he
          refuses the rite of initiation to him <span class=

          Oration is a <span class="tei tei-q">“speech of consolation”</span>
          (παραμυθητικὸς λόγος), a familiar type of Sophistic composition. In
          consequence of the attacks on Sallust by sycophants at court, and
          moreover jealous of his friendship with Julian, Constantius ordered
          him to leave Gaul. In this discourse, which was written before the
          open rupture with Constantius, Julian alludes only once and
          respectfully to his cousin. But Asmus thinks he can detect in it a
          general resemblance to the Thirteenth Oration of Dio Chrysostom,
          where Dio tries to comfort himself for his banishment by the tyrant
          Domitian, and that Sallust was expected to appreciate this and the
          veiled attack on Constantius. Julian addresses the discourse to
          himself, but it was no doubt sent to Sallust.</p>

          comrade, unless I tell you all that I said to myself when I learned
          that you were compelled to journey far from my side, I shall think
          I am deprived of some comfort; or rather, I shall consider that I
          have not even begun to procure some assuagement for my grief unless
          I have first shared it with you. For we two have shared in many
          sorrows and also in many pleasant deeds and words, in affairs
          private and public, at home and in the field, and therefore for the
          present troubles, be they what they may, we must needs discover
          some cure, some remedy that both can share. But who will imitate
          for us the lyre of Orpheus, who will echo for us the songs of the
          Sirens or discover the drug nepenthe?<a id="noteref_294" name=

          Though that was perhaps some tale full of Egyptian lore or such a
          tale as the poet himself invented, when in what follows he wove in
          the story of the sorrows of the Trojans, and Helen had learned it
          from the Egyptians; I do not mean a tale of all the woes that the
          Greeks and Trojans inflicted on one another, but rather tales such
          as they must be that will dispel the griefs of men's souls and have
          power to restore cheerfulness and calm. For pleasure and pain,
          methinks, are connected at their source<a id="noteref_295" name=

          succeed each other in turn. And philosophers assert that in all
          that befalls the wise man the very greatest trials afford him as
          much felicity as vexation; and thus, as they say, does the bee
          extract sweet dew from the bitterest herb that grows on Hymettus
          and works it into honey.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296"

          so bodies that are naturally healthy and robust are nourished by
          any kind of food, and food that often seems unwholesome for others,
          far from injuring them, makes them strong. On the other hand, the
          slightest causes usually inflict very serious injuries on persons
          who by nature or nurture, or owing to their habits, have an unsound
          constitution and are lifelong invalids. Just so with regard to the
          mind: those who have so trained it that it is not altogether
          unhealthy but moderately sound, though it do not indeed exhibit the
          vigour of Antisthenes or Socrates, or the courage of Callisthenes,
          or the imperturbability of Polemon, but so that it can under the
          same conditions as theirs adopt the golden mean, they, I say, will
          probably be able to remain cheerful in more trying conditions.)</p>

          from resenting this, I rather rejoice at it. For to accept

          independently to decide oneself what one ought to do; and so he

          all Libya made subject to Rome, Africanus sent Laelius home and he
          embarked to carry the good news to their fatherland. And Scipio was
          grieved at the separation from his friend, but he did not think his
          sorrow inconsolable. Laelius too was probably afflicted at having
          to embark alone, but he did not regard it as an insupportable
          calamity. Cato also made a voyage and left his intimate friends at
          home, and so did Pythagoras and Plato and Democritus, and they took
          with them no companion on their travels, though they left behind
          them at home many whom they dearly loved. Pericles also set out on
          his campaign against Samos without taking Anaxagoras, and he
          conquered Euboea by following the latter's advice, for he had been
          trained by his teaching: but the philosopher himself he did not
          drag in his train as though he were part of the equipment needed
          for battle. And yet in his case too we are told that much against
          his will the Athenians separated him from the society of his
          teacher. But wise man that he was, he bore the folly of his
          fellow-citizens with fortitude and mildness. Indeed he thought that
          he must of necessity bow to his country's will when, as a mother
          might, however unjustly, she still resented their close friendship;
          and he probably reasoned as follows. (You must take what I say next
          as the very words of Pericles.<a id="noteref_327" name=

          the country where I was born, since this is the divine law, and to
          obey all her commands and not oppose them, or as the proverb says
          kick against the pricks. For inexorable, as the saying goes, is the
          yoke of necessity. But we must not even complain or lament when her
          commands are harsher than usual, but rather consider the matter as
          it actually is. She now orders Anaxagoras to leave me and I shall
          see no more my best friend, on whose account the night was hateful
          to me because it did not allow me to see my friend, but I was
          grateful to daylight and the sun because they allowed me to see him

          Pericles, if nature had given you eyes only as she has to wild

          But since she has breathed into you a soul, and implanted in you
          intelligence by means of which you now behold in memory many past
          events, though they are no longer before you: and further since
          your reasoning power discovers many future events and reveals them
          as it were to the eyes of your mind; and again your imagination
          sketches for you not only those present events which are going on
          under your eyes and allows you to judge and survey them, but also

          see one who is in Ionia; and from the country of the Celts one who
          is in Illyria or Thrace; and from Thrace or Illyria one who is in
          the country of the Celts. And moreover, though plants if removed
          from their native soil when the weather and the season are
          unfavourable cannot be kept alive, it is not so with men, who can
          remove from one place to another without completely deteriorating
          or changing their character and deviating from the right principles
          that they had before adopted. It is therefore unlikely that our
          affection will become blunted, if indeed we do not love and cherish
          each other the more for the separation. For <span class=

          love and longing on want. So in this respect we shall be better off
          if our affection tends to increase, and we shall keep one another
          firmly set in our minds like holy images. And one moment I shall
          see Anaxagoras, and the next he will see me. Though nothing
          prevents our seeing one another at the same instant; I do not mean
          our flesh and sinews and <span class="tei tei-q">‘bodily outline

          the bodily original—though perhaps there is no reason why these too
          should not become visible to our minds—but I mean our virtue, our
          deeds and words, our intercourse, and those conversations which we
          so often held with one another, when in perfect harmony we sang the
          praises of education and justice and mind that governs all things
          mortal and human: when too we discussed the art of government, and
          law, and the different ways of being virtuous and the noblest
          pursuits, everything in short that occurred to us when, as occasion
          served, we mentioned these subjects. If we reflect on these things
          and nourish ourselves with these images, we shall probably pay no

          will the senses corrupted by the alloy of the body exhibit to our
          minds empty and vain phantoms. For we shall not employ the senses
          at all to assist and minister to us, but our minds will have
          escaped from them and so will be exercised on the themes I have
          mentioned and aroused to comprehend and associate with things
          incorporeal. For by the mind we commune even with God, and by its
          aid we are enabled to see and to grasp things that escape the
          senses and are far apart in space, or rather have no need of space:
          that is to say, all of us who have lived so as to deserve such a
          vision, conceiving it in the mind and laying hold
          thereof.”</span>)</p>

          my soul. And first and foremost of the hardships that I shall have
          to face is this, that now I shall be bereft of our guileless
          intercourse and unreserved conversation. For I have no one now to
          whom I can talk with anything like the same confidence. What, you
          say, cannot I easily converse with myself? Nay, will not some one
          rob me even of my thoughts, and besides compel me to think
          differently, and to admire what I prefer not to admire? Or does
          this robbery amount to a prodigy unimaginable, like writing on
          water or boiling a stone,<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342"
          href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> or
          tracing the track of the flight of birds on the wing? Well then
          since no one can deprive us of our thoughts, we shall surely
          commune with ourselves in some fashion, and perhaps God will
          suggest some alleviation. For it is not likely that he who entrusts
          himself to God will be utterly neglected and left wholly desolate.
          But over him God stretches his hand,<a id="noteref_343" name=
          "noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class=

          endues him with strength, inspires him with courage, and puts into
          his mind what he must do. We know too how a divine voice
          accompanied Socrates and prevented him from doing what he ought
          not. And Homer also says of Achilles, <span class="tei tei-q">“She
          put the thought in his mind,”</span><a id="noteref_344" name=
          "noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class=

          implying that it is God who suggests our thoughts when the mind
          turns inwards and first communes with itself, and then with God
          alone by itself, hindered by nothing external. For the mind needs
          no ears to learn with, still less does God need a voice to teach us
          our duty: but apart from all sense-perception, communion with God
          is vouchsafed to the mind. How and in what manner I have not now
          leisure to inquire, but that this does happen is evident, and there
          are sure witnesses thereof—men not obscure or only fit to be
          classed with the Megarians,<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345"

          and not to imitate the Homeric heroes, or to think that whereas God
          was ever ready to assist them he will disregard the men of our day,
          if he sees that they are striving to attain that very virtue for
          which he favoured those others. For it was not physical beauty that

          consideration which, though it seems trivial, nevertheless is

          felt a need for Homer, not, of course, to be his companion, but to
          be his herald, as he was for Achilles and Patroclus and the two
          Ajaxes and Antilochus. But Alexander, ever despising what he had
          and longing for what he had not, could never be content with his
          contemporaries or be satisfied with the gifts that had been granted
          to him. And even if Homer had fallen to his lot he would probably

          Alexander's case, whether a superabundance of virtue and an
          intelligence that matched the advantages with which he was endowed
          exalted his soul to such heights of ambition that he aimed at
          greater achievements than are within the scope of other men; or
          whether the cause was an excess of courage and valour that led him
          into ostentation and bordered on sinful pride, must be left as a
          general topic for consideration by those who desire to write either
          a panegyric of him or a criticism; if indeed anyone thinks that
          criticism also can properly be applied to him. I on the contrary
          can always be content with what I have and am the last to covet
          what I have not, and so am well content when my praises are uttered
          by a herald who has been an eyewitness and comrade-in-arms in all
          that I have done; and who has never admitted any statements
          invented at random out of partiality or prejudice. And it is enough
          for me if he only admit his love for me, though on all else he were
          more silent than those initiated by Pythagoras.)</p>

          Themistius may be called a scholar, though hardly a philosopher as
          he himself claimed. Technically he was a Sophist: that is to say he
          gave public lectures (ἐπιδείξεις), wrote exercises after the
          Sophistic pattern and went on embassies, which were entrusted to
          him solely on account of his persuasive charm. But he insisted that
          he was no Sophist, because he took no fees<a id="noteref_365" name=

          since Constantius made him a Senator, he cannot have betrayed any
          zeal for the Pagan religion. From Julian's Pagan restoration he
          seems to have held aloof, and, though Julian had been his pupil,
          probably at Nicomedia, he did not appoint him to any office. Under
          the Christian Emperor Theodosius he held a prefecture. There is no
          evidence for a positive coolness, such as Zeller<a id="noteref_368"

          their relations to assert with some critics that the respectful

          that would not suit an earlier date; it is sometimes assigned to
          355 when Julian was still Caesar. The quotations from Aristotle are

          just as those who carry heavy burdens lighten their labour by
          singing.<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href=

          by your recent letter you have increased my fears, and you point to
          an enterprise in every way more difficult. You say that God has
          placed me in the same position as Heracles and Dionysus of old who,
          being at once philosophers and kings, purged almost the whole earth
          and sea of the evils that infested them. You bid me shake off all
          thought of leisure and inactivity that I may prove to be a good
          soldier worthy of so high a destiny. And besides those examples you
          go on to remind me of law-givers such as Solon, Pittacus, and
          Lycurgus, and you say that men have the right to expect from me now
          greater things than from any of these. When I read these words I
          was almost dumbfounded; for on the one hand I was sure that it was
          unlawful for you as a philosopher to flatter or deceive; on the
          other hand I am fully conscious that by nature there is nothing
          remarkable about me—there never was from the first nor has there
          come to be now,—but as regards philosophy I have only fallen in
          love with it (I say nothing of the fates that have intervened<a id=

          make that love so far ineffectual). I could not tell therefore how
          I ought to interpret such expressions, until God brought it into my
          mind that perhaps by your very praises you wished to exhort me, and
          to point out how great are those trials to which a statesman must
          inevitably be exposed every day of his life.)</p>

          were finding even that none too easy or safe, and then suppose some
          professional soothsayer should tell him that he would have to
          traverse the Aegaean and then the Ionian Sea, and finally embark on
          the outer sea. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here,”</span> that prophet
          would say, <span class="tei tei-q">“you see towns and harbours, but
          when you arrive there you will see not so much as a watch-tower or
          a rock, but you will be thankful to descry even a ship in the
          distance and to hail her crew. You will often pray to God that you
          may, however late, touch land and reach a harbour, though that were
          to be the last day of your life. You will pray to be allowed to
          bring home your ship safe and sound and restore your crew unscathed
          to their friends, and then to commit your body to mother earth. And
          this indeed may happen, but you will not be sure of it until that
          final day.”</span> Do you think that such a man after being told
          all this would choose even to live in a sea-port town? Would he not
          bid adieu to money-making and all the advantages of commerce, and
          caring little for troops of friends and acquaintances abroad, and
          all that he might learn about nations and cities, would he not

          you apparently perceived this, and by your abuse of Epicurus you
          tried to forestall me and to eradicate beforehand any such purpose.
          For you go on to say that it was to be expected that so idle a man
          as he should commend leisure and conversations during walks. Now
          for my part I have long been firmly convinced that Epicurus was
          mistaken in that view of his, but whether it be proper to urge into
          public life any and every man, both him who lacks natural abilities
          and him who is not yet completely equipped, is a point that
          deserves the most careful consideration. We are told that Socrates
          dissuaded from the statesman's profession<a id="noteref_381" name=

          but could not curb the youth's impetuous ambition. Then shall we
          try to force into that career men who are reluctant and conscious
          of their deficiencies, and urge them to be self-confident about
          such great tasks? For in such matters not virtue alone or a wise
          policy is paramount, but to a far greater degree Fortune holds sway
          throughout and compels events to incline as she wills.
          Chrysippus<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href=
          "#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a>
          indeed, though in other respects he seems a wise man and to have
          been rightly so esteemed, yet in ignoring fortune and chance and
          all other such external causes that fall in to block the path of
          men of affairs, he uttered paradoxes wholly at variance with facts
          about which the past teaches us clearly by countless examples. For
          instance, shall we call Cato a fortunate and happy man? Or shall we
          say that Dio of Sicily had a happy lot? It is true that for death
          they probably cared nothing, but they did care greatly about not
          leaving unfinished the undertakings which they had originally set
          on foot, and to secure that end there is nothing that they would
          not have endured. In that they were disappointed, and I admit that
          they bore their lot with great dignity, as we learn, and derived no
          small consolation from their virtue; but happy one could not call
          them, seeing that they had failed in all those noble enterprises,
          unless perhaps according to the Stoic conception of happiness. And
          with regard to that same Stoic conception we must admit that to be
          applauded and to be counted happy are two very different things,
          and that if every living thing naturally desires happiness,<a id=
          "noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> it is
          better to make it our aim to be congratulated on the score of
          happiness rather than to be applauded on the score of virtue. But
          happiness that depends on the chances of Fortune is very rarely
          secure. And yet men who are engaged in public life cannot, as the
          saying is, so much as breathe unless she is on their side ... and
          they have created a merely verbal idea of a leader who is
          established somewhere above all the chances of Fortune in the
          sphere of things incorporeal and intelligible, just as men define
          the ideas, whether envisaging them truly or falsely imagining them.
          Or again they give us the ideal man, according to Diogenes)</p>

          taught it to me, but I have set down the speech which runs
          something like this, and offer it as a proof that I am not really
          indolent. <span class="tei tei-q">“God governs all things and with
          God Fortune and Opportunity govern all human affairs: but there is

          then indicates what must be the character of a man who is the
          craftsman and artificer of noble deeds and a divinely inspired
          king. Then he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Kronos therefore, as I
          have already related, knew that human nature when endowed with
          supreme authority is never in any case capable of managing human
          affairs without being filled with insolence and injustice;
          therefore, having regard to this he at that time set over our
          cities as kings and governors not men but beings of a more divine
          and higher race, I mean demons; thus doing as we do now for our
          flocks and domestic herds. We never appoint certain oxen to rule
          over other oxen or goats to rule over goats, but we are their
          masters, a race superior to theirs. In like manner then God, since
          he loves mankind, has set over us a race of beings superior to
          ourselves, the race of demons; and they with great ease both to
          themselves and us undertake the care of us and dispense peace,
          reverence, aye, and above all justice without stint, and thus they
          make the tribes of men harmonious and happy. And that account is a
          true one which declares that in our day all cities that are
          governed not by a god but by a mortal man have no relief from evils
          and hardships. And the lesson is that we ought by every means in
          our power to imitate that life which is said to have existed in the
          days of Kronos: and in so far as the principle of immortality is in
          us we ought to be guided by it in our management of public and
          private affairs, of our houses and cities, calling the distribution

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I have
          purposely set down the whole of this speech for you lest you should
          think that I am cheating and defrauding by bringing forward ancient
          myths which may have some resemblance to the truth, but on the
          whole are not composed with regard to truth. But what is the true
          meaning of this narrative? You hear what it says, that even though
          a prince be by nature human, he must in his conduct be divine and a
          demi-god and must completely banish from his soul all that is
          mortal and brutish, except what must remain to safeguard the needs
          of the body. Now if, reflecting on this, one is afraid to be
          constrained to adopt a life from which so much is expected, do you
          therefore conclude that one admires the inaction recommended by
          Epicurus, the gardens and suburbs of Athens and its myrtles, or the
          humble home of Socrates? But never has anyone seen me prefer these
          to a life of toil. That toil of mine I would willingly recount to
          you, and the hazards that threatened me from my friends and
          kinsfolk at the time when I began to study under you, if you did
          not yourself know them well enough. You are well aware of what I
          did, in the first place, in Ionia in opposition to one who was
          related to me by ties of blood, but even more closely by ties of
          friendship, and that in behalf of a foreigner with whom I was very
          slightly acquainted, I mean the sophist. Did I not endure to leave
          the country for the sake of my friends? Indeed, you know how I took
          the part of Carterius when I went unsolicited to our friend Araxius
          to plead for him. And in behalf of the property of that admirable
          woman Arete and the wrongs she had suffered from her neighbours,
          did I not journey to Phrygia for the second time within two months,
          though I was physically very weak from the illness that had been
          brought on by former fatigues?<a id="noteref_396" name=

          Finally, before I went to Greece, while I was still with the army
          and running what most people would call the greatest possible
          risks, recall now what sort of letters I wrote to you, never filled
          with complaints or containing anything little or mean or servile.
          And when I returned to Greece, when everyone regarded me as an
          exile, did I not welcome my fate as though it were some high
          festival, and did I not say that the exchange to me was most
          delightful, and that, as the saying is, I had thereby gained)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(To me, at any
          rate, it seems that the task of reigning is beyond human powers,
          and that a king needs a more divine character, as indeed Plato too
          used to say. And now I will write out a passage from Aristotle to
          the same effect, not <span class="tei tei-q">“bringing owls to the
          Athenians,”</span><a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href=
          "#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> but
          in order to show you that I do not entirely neglect his writings.
          In his political treatises he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now
          even if one maintain the principle that it is best for cities to be
          governed by a king, how will it be about his children? Ought his
          children to succeed him? And yet if they prove to be no better than
          anybody else, that would be a bad thing for the city. But you may
          say, though he has the power he will not leave the succession to
          his children? It is difficult indeed to believe that he will not;
          for that would be too hard for him, and demands a virtue greater
          than belongs to human nature.”</span><a id="noteref_405" name=
          "noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a> And
          later on, when he is describing a so-called king who rules
          according to law, and says that he is both the servant and guardian
          of the laws, he does not call him a king at all, nor does he
          consider such a king as a distinct form of government; and he goes
          on to say: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now as for what is called
          absolute monarchy, that is to say, when a king governs all other
          men according to his own will, some people think that it is not in
          accordance with the nature of things for one man to have absolute
          authority over all the citizens; since those who are by nature
          equal must necessarily have the same rights.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a>
          Again, a little later he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It seems,
          therefore, that he who bids Reason rule is really preferring the
          rule of God and the laws, but he who bids man rule, adds an element
          of the beast. For desire is a wild beast, and passion which warps
          even the best men. It follows, therefore, that law is Reason exempt
          from desire.”</span> You see the philosopher seems here clearly to
          distrust and condemn human nature. For he says so in so many words
          when he asserts that human nature is in no case worthy of such an
          excess of fortune. For he thinks that it is too hard for one who is
          merely human to prefer the general weal of the citizens to his own
          children; he says that it is not just that one man should rule over
          many who are his equals; and, finally, he puts the finishing
          stroke<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href=
          "#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> to
          what he has just said when he asserts that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“law is Reason exempt from desire,”</span> and that
          political affairs ought to be entrusted to Reason alone, and not to
          any individual man whatever. For the reason that is in men, however
          good they may be, is entangled with passion and desire, those most
          ferocious monsters. These opinions, it seems to me, harmonise
          perfectly with Plato's; first, that he who governs ought to be
          superior to his subjects and surpass them not only in his acquired
          habits but also in natural endowment; a thing which is not easy to
          find among men;... thirdly, that he ought by every means in his
          power to observe the laws, not those that were framed to meet some
          sudden emergency, or established, as now appears, by men whose
          lives were not wholly guided by reason; but he must observe them
          only in case the lawgiver, having purified his mind and soul, in
          enacting those laws keeps in view not merely the crimes of the
          moment or immediate contingencies; but rather recognises the nature
          of government and the essential nature of justice, and has
          carefully observed also the essential nature of guilt, and then
          applies to his task all the knowledge thus derived, and frames laws
          which have a general application to all the citizens without regard
          to friend or foe, neighbour or kinsman. And it is better that such
          a lawgiver should frame and promulgate his laws not for his
          contemporaries only but for posterity also, or for strangers with
          whom he neither has nor expects to have any private dealings. For
          instance, I hear that the wise Solon, having consulted his friends
          about the cancelling of debts, furnished them with an opportunity
          to make money, but brought on himself a disgraceful
          accusation.<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href=
          "#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> So
          hard is it to avoid such fatalities, even when a man brings a
          passionless mind to the task of governing.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But I should
          like to make clear to you the points in your letter by which I am
          puzzled, my dearest friend to whom I especially am bound to pay
          every honour: for I am eager to be more precisely informed about
          them. You said that you approve a life of action rather than the
          philosophic life, and you called to witness the wise Aristotle who
          defines happiness as virtuous activity, and discussing the
          difference between the statesman's life and the life of
          contemplation, showed a certain hesitation about those lives, and
          though in others of his writings he preferred the contemplative
          life, in this place you say he approves the architects of noble
          actions. But it is you who assert that these are kings, whereas
          Aristotle does not speak in the sense of the words that you have
          introduced: and from what you have quoted one would rather infer
          the contrary. For when he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“We most
          correctly use the word <span class="tei tei-q">‘act’</span> of
          those who are the architects of public affairs by virtue of their
          intelligence,”</span><a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href=

          must suppose that what he says applies to lawgivers and political
          philosophers and all whose activity consists in the use of
          intelligence and reason, but that it does not apply to those who do
          the work themselves and those who transact the business of
          politics. But in their case it is not enough that they should
          consider and devise and instruct others as to what must be done,
          but it is their duty to undertake and execute whatever the laws
          ordain and circumstances as well often force them; unless indeed we
          call that man an architect who is <span class="tei tei-q">“well

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But if we
          conceive this to be true, or that only those are happy who
          administer public affairs and who are in authority and rule over
          many, what then are we to say about Socrates? As for Pythagoras and
          Democritus and Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, you will perhaps say that
          they were happy in another sense of the word, because of their
          philosophic speculations. But as for Socrates who, having rejected
          the speculative life and embraced a life of action, had no
          authority over his own wife or his son, can we say of him that he
          governed even two or three of his fellow-citizens? Then will you
          assert that since he had no authority over any one he accomplished
          nothing? On the contrary I maintain that the son of

          Phaedo and a host of others; not to mention the offshoots derived
          from the same source, the Lyceum, the Stoa and the Academies. Who,
          I ask, ever found salvation through the conquests of Alexander?
          What city was ever more wisely governed because of them, what
          individual improved? Many indeed you might find whom those
          conquests enriched, but not one whom they made wiser or more
          temperate than he was by nature, if indeed they have not made him
          more insolent and arrogant. Whereas all who now find their
          salvation in philosophy owe it to Socrates. And I am not the only
          person to perceive this fact and to express it, for Aristotle it
          seems did so before me, when he said that he had just as much right
          to be proud of his treatise on the gods as the conqueror<a id=
          "noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> of
          the Persian empire. And I think he was perfectly correct in that
          conclusion. For military success is due to courage and good fortune
          more than anything else or, let us say, if you wish, to
          intelligence as well, though of the common everyday sort. But to
          conceive true opinions about God is an achievement that not only
          requires perfect virtue, but one might well hesitate whether it be
          proper to call one who attains to this a man or a god. For if the
          saying is true that it is the nature of everything to become known
          to those who have an affinity with it, then he who comes to know
          the essential nature of God would naturally be considered
          divine.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg

          comparing it with the life of action, though in the beginning of
          your letter you declined to make the comparison, I will remind you
          of those very philosophers whom you mentioned, Areius,<a id=

          Thrasyllus,<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> and
          Musonius.<a id="noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href=
          "#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a> So
          far from any one of these governing his own city, Areius we are
          told refused the governorship of Egypt when it was offered to him,
          and Thrasyllus by becoming intimate with the harsh and naturally
          cruel tyrant Tiberius would have incurred indelible disgrace for
          all time, had he not cleared himself in the writings that he left
          behind him and so shown his true character; so little did his
          public career benefit him. Nicolaus did not personally do any great
          deeds, and he is known rather by his writings about such deeds;
          while Musonius became famous because he bore his sufferings with
          courage, and, by Zeus, sustained with firmness the cruelty of
          tyrants; and perhaps he was not less happy than those who
          administered great kingdoms. As for Areius, when he declined the
          governorship of Egypt he deliberately deprived himself of the
          highest end, if he really thought that this was the most important
          thing. And you yourself,—may I ask, do you lead an inactive life
          because you are not a general or a public speaker and govern no
          nation or city? Nay, no one with any sense would say so. For it is
          in your power by producing many philosophers, or even only three or
          four, to confer more benefit on the lives of men than many kings
          put together. To no trivial province the philosopher appointed,
          and, as you said yourself, he does not only direct counsels or
          public affairs, nor is his activity confined to mere words; but if
          he confirm his words by deeds and show himself to be such as he
          wishes others to be, he may be more convincing and more effective
          in making men act than those who urge them to noble actions by
          issuing commands.)</p>

          back to what I said at the beginning, and conclude this letter,
          which is perhaps longer already than it should be. And the main
          point in it is that it is not because I would avoid hard work or
          pursue pleasure, nor because I am in love with idleness and ease
          that I am averse to spending my life in administration. But, as I
          said when I began, it is because I am conscious that I have neither
          sufficient training nor natural talents above the ordinary;
          moreover, I am afraid of bringing reproach on philosophy, which,
          much as I love it, I have never attained to, and which on other

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the
          manifestoes addressed by Julian to Rome, Sparta, Corinth, and
          Athens, defending his acceptance of the title of Emperor and his
          open rupture with Constantius, the last alone survives. It was
          written in Illyricum in 361, when Julian was on the march against
          Constantius, and is the chief authority for the events that led to
          his elevation to the Imperial rank. Julian writes to the Athenians
          of the fourth Christian century as though they still possessed the
          influence and standards of their forefathers. He was well known at
          Athens, where he had studied before his elevation to the Caesarship
          and he was anxious to clear himself in the eyes of the citizens.
          For the first time he ventures to speak the truth about Constantius
          and to describe the latter's ruthless treatment of his family. His
          account of the revolution at Paris is supplemented by Ammianus 20,
          Zosimus 3. 9, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Many were the
          achievements of your forefathers of which you are still justly
          proud, even as they were of old; many were the trophies for
          victories raised by them, now for all Greece in common, now
          separately for Athens herself, in those days when she contended
          single-handed against all the rest of Greece as well as against the
          barbarian: but there was no achievement and no display of courage
          on your part so prodigious that other cities cannot in their turn
          rival it. For they too wrought some such deeds in alliance with
          you, and some on their own account. And that I may not by recalling
          these and then balancing them be thought either to pay more honour
          to one state than to another in the matters in which they are your
          rivals, or to praise less than they deserve those who proved
          inferior, in order to gain an advantage, after the manner of
          rhetoricians, I desire to bring forward on your behalf only this
          fact to which I can discover nothing that can be set against it on
          the part of the other Greek states, and which has been assigned to
          you by ancient tradition. When the Lacedaemonians were in power you
          took that power away from them not by violence but by your
          reputation for justice; and it was your laws that nurtured
          Aristides the Just. Moreover, brilliant as were these proofs of
          your virtue, you confirmed them by still more brilliant actions.
          For to be reputed just might perhaps happen to any individual even
          though it were not true; perhaps it would not be surprising that
          among many worthless citizens there should be found one virtuous
          man. For even among the Medes is not a certain Deioces<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a> among
          the Scythians? And in their case the surprising thing was that,
          born as they were among nations who knew nothing of justice, they
          nevertheless prized justice, two of them sincerely, though the
          third only pretended to do so out of self-interest. But it would be
          hard to find a whole people and city enamoured of just deeds and
          just words except your own. And I wish to remind you of one out of
          very many such deeds done in your city. After the Persian war
          Themistocles<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href=

          planning to introduce a resolution to set fire secretly to the
          naval arsenals of the Greeks, and then did not dare to propose it
          to the assembly; but he agreed to confide the secret to any one man
          whom the people should elect by vote; and the people chose
          Aristides to represent them. But he when he heard the scheme did
          not reveal what he had been told, but reported to the people that
          there could be nothing more profitable or more dishonest than that
          advice. Whereupon the city at once voted against it and rejected
          it, very nobly, by Zeus, and as it behoved men to do who are
          nurtured under the eyes of the most wise goddess.<a id=

          was your conduct of old, and from that day to this there is kept
          alive some small spark as it were of the virtue of your ancestors,
          it is natural that you should pay attention not to the magnitude
          merely of any performance, nor whether a man has travelled over the
          earth with incredible speed and unwearied energy as though he had
          flown through the air; but that you should rather consider whether
          one has accomplished this feat by just means, and then if he seems
          to act with justice, you will perhaps all praise him both in public
          and private; but if he have slighted justice he will naturally be
          scorned by you. For there is nothing so closely akin to wisdom as
          justice. Therefore those who slight her you will justly expel as
          showing impiety towards the goddess who dwells among you. For this
          reason I wish to report my conduct to you, though indeed you know
          it well, in order that if there is anything you do not know—and it
          is likely that some things you do not, and those in fact which it
          is most important for all men to be aware of—it may become known to
          you and through you to the rest of the Greeks. Therefore let no one

          account of things that have happened as it were before the eyes of

          father's side I am descended from the same stock as Constantius on
          his father's side is well known. Our fathers were brothers, sons of
          the same father. And close kinsmen as we were, how this most humane
          Emperor treated us! Six of my cousins and his, and my father who
          was his own uncle and also another uncle of both of us on the
          father's side, and my eldest brother, he put to death without a

          intended to put us to death but finally inflicted exile upon us;
          and from that exile he released me, but him he stripped of the

          <span class="tei tei-q">“recount,”</span> as though from some

          he has repented, I am told, and is stung by remorse; and he thinks

          his ill success in the Persian war he also ascribes to that cause.
          This at least was the gossip of the court at the time and of those
          who were about the person of my brother Gallus of blessed memory,
          who is now for the first time so styled. For after putting him to
          death in defiance of the laws he neither suffered him to share the
          tombs of his ancestors nor granted him a pious memory.)</p>

          to the violence and tumult of an undisciplined and mutinous army.

          summoned him from exile in Tralles and had dragged me from the
          schools, though I was still a mere boy. How shall I describe the
          six years we spent there? For we lived as though on the estate of a
          stranger, and were watched as though we were in some Persian
          garrison, since no stranger came to see us and not one of our old
          friends was allowed to visit us; so that we lived shut off from
          every liberal study and from all free intercourse, in a glittering
          servitude, and sharing the exercises of our own slaves though they
          were comrades. For no companion of our own age ever came near us or
          was allowed to do so.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(From that place
          barely and by the help of the gods I was set free, and for a
          happier fate; but my brother was imprisoned at court and his fate
          was ill-starred above all men who have ever yet lived. And indeed
          whatever cruelty or harshness was revealed in his disposition was
          increased by his having been brought up among those mountains. It
          is therefore I think only just that the Emperor should bear the
          blame for this also, he who against our will allotted to us that
          sort of bringing-up. As for me, the gods by means of philosophy
          caused me to remain untouched by it and unharmed; but on my brother
          no one bestowed this boon. For when he had come straight from the
          country to the court, the moment that Constantius had invested him
          with the purple robe he at once began to be jealous of him, nor did
          he cease from that feeling until, not content with stripping him of
          the purple, he had destroyed him. Yet surely he deserved to live,
          even if he seemed unfit to govern. But someone may say that it was
          necessary to deprive him of life also. I admit it, only on
          condition that he had first been allowed to speak in his own
          defence as criminals are. For surely it is not the case that the
          law forbids one who has imprisoned bandits to put them to death,
          but says that it is right to destroy without a trial those who have
          been stripped of the honours that they possessed and have become
          mere individuals instead of rulers. For what if my brother had been
          able to expose those who were responsible for his errors? For there
          had been handed to him the letters of certain persons, and, by
          Heracles, what accusations against himself they contained! And in
          his resentment at these he gave way in most unkingly fashion to
          uncontrolled anger, but he had done nothing to deserve being
          deprived of life itself. What! Is not this a universal law among
          all Greeks and barbarians alike, that one should defend oneself
          against those who take the initiative in doing one a wrong? I admit
          that he did perhaps defend himself with too great cruelty; but on
          the whole not more cruelly than might have been expected. For we
          have heard it said before<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439"
          href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> that
          an enemy may be expected to harm one in a fit of anger. But it was
          to gratify a eunuch,<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href=
          "#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> his
          chamberlain who was also his chief cook, that Constantius gave over
          to his most inveterate enemies his own cousin, the Caesar, his
          sister's husband, the father of his niece, the man whose own sister
          he had himself married in earlier days,<a id="noteref_441" name=
          "noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> and
          to whom he owed so many obligations connected with the gods of the
          family. As for me he reluctantly let me go, after dragging me
          hither and thither for seven whole months and keeping me under
          guard; so that had not some one of the gods desired that I should
          escape, and made the beautiful and virtuous Eusebia kindly disposed
          to me, I could not then have escaped from his hands myself. And yet
          I call the gods to witness that my brother had pursued his course
          of action without my having a sight of him even in a dream. For I
          was not with him, nor did I visit him or travel to his
          neighbourhood; and I used to write to him very seldom and on
          unimportant matters. Thinking therefore that I had escaped from
          that place, I set out for the house that had been my mother's. For
          of my father's estate nothing belonged to me, and I had acquired
          out of the great wealth that had naturally belonged to my father
          not the smallest clod of earth, not a slave, not a house. For the
          admirable Constantius had inherited in my place the whole of my
          father's property, and to me, as I was saying, he granted not the
          least trifle of it; moreover, though he gave my brother a few
          things that had been his father's, he robbed him of the whole of
          his mother's estate.)</p>

          in fact what he did was to impose on me the most galling and
          irksome slavery—you have heard, if not every detail, still the
          greater part. As I was saying, I was on my way to my home and was

          fabricated the rumour against certain persons there that they were
          planning a revolt. You certainly know by hearsay Africanus<a id=

          Marinus: nor can you fail to have heard of Felix and what was the
          fate of those men. And when Constantius was informed of the matter,
          and Dynamius another sycophant suddenly reported from Gaul that
          Silvanus<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href=

          on the point of declaring himself his open enemy, in the utmost
          alarm and terror he forthwith sent to me, and first he bade me
          retire for a short time to Greece, then summoned me from there to
          the court<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href=

          again. He had never seen me before except once in Cappadocia and
          once in Italy,—an interview which Eusebia had secured by her
          exertions so that I might feel confidence about my personal safety.
          And yet I lived for six months in the same city<a id="noteref_450"

          did, and he had promised that he would see me again. But that

          trusty chamberlain, unconsciously and involuntarily proved himself
          my benefactor. For he did not allow me to meet the Emperor often,
          nor perhaps did the latter desire it; still the eunuch was the
          chief reason. For what he dreaded was that if we had any
          intercourse with one another I might be taken into favour, and when
          my loyalty became evident I might be given some place of
          trust.)</p>

          kept showing me the utmost kindness through the eunuchs of her

          barber's shop, cut off my beard and dressed me in a military cloak
          and transformed me into a highly ridiculous soldier, as they
          thought at the time. For none of the decorations of those villains
          suited me. And I walked not like them, staring about me and
          strutting along, but gazing on the ground as I had been trained to
          do by the preceptor<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(What happened
          was somewhat as follows. When I came to Milan I resided in one of
          the suburbs. Thither Eusebia sent me on several occasions messages
          of good-will, and urged me to write to her without hesitation about
          anything that I desired. Accordingly I wrote her a letter, or
          rather a petition containing vows like these: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“May you have children to succeed you; may God grant
          you this and that, if only you send me home as quickly as
          possible!”</span> But I suspected that it was not safe to send to
          the palace letters addressed to the Emperor's wife. Therefore I
          besought the gods to inform me at night whether I ought to send the
          letter to the Empress. And they warned me that if I sent it I
          should meet the most ignominious death. I call all the gods to
          witness that what I write here is true. For this reason, therefore,
          I forbore to send the letter. But from that night there kept
          occurring to me an argument which it is perhaps worth your while
          also to hear. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> I said to
          myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am planning to oppose the gods,
          and I have imagined that I can devise wiser schemes for myself than
          those who know all things. And yet human wisdom, which looks only
          to the present moment, may be thankful if, with all its efforts, it
          succeed in avoiding mistakes even for a short space. That is why no
          man takes thought for things that are to happen thirty years hence,
          or for things that are already past, for the one is superfluous,
          the other impossible, but only for what lies near at hand and has
          already some beginnings and germs. But the wisdom of the gods sees
          very far, or rather, sees the whole, and therefore it directs
          aright and brings to pass what is best. For they are the causes of
          all that now is, and so likewise of all that is to be. Wherefore it
          is reasonable that they should have knowledge about the
          present.”</span> So far, then, it seemed to me that on this
          reasoning my second determination was wiser than my first. And
          viewing the matter in the light of justice, I immediately
          reflected: <span class="tei tei-q">“Would you not be provoked if
          one of your own beasts were to deprive you of its services,<a id=
          "noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a> or
          were even to run away when you called it, a horse, or sheep, or
          calf, as the case might be? And will you, who pretended to be a
          man, and not even a man of the common herd or from the dregs of the
          people, but one belonging to the superior and reasonable class,
          deprive the gods of your service, and not trust yourself to them to
          dispose of you as they please? Beware lest you not only fall into
          great folly, but also neglect your proper duties towards the gods.
          Where is your courage, and of what sort is it? A sorry thing it
          seems. At any rate, you are ready to cringe and flatter from fear
          of death, and yet it is in your power to lay all that aside and
          leave it to the gods to work their will, dividing with them the
          care of yourself, as Socrates, for instance, chose to do: and you
          might, while doing such things as best you can, commit the whole to
          their charge; seek to possess nothing, seize nothing, but accept
          simply what is vouchsafed to you by them.”</span> And this course I
          thought was not only safe but becoming to a reasonable man, since
          the response of the gods had suggested it. For to rush headlong
          into unseemly and foreseen danger while trying to avoid future
          plots seemed to me a topsy-turvy procedure. Accordingly I consented
          to yield. And immediately I was invested with the title and robe of
          Caesar.<a id="noteref_461" name="noteref_461" href=

          slavery that ensued and the fear for my very life that hung over me
          every day, Heracles, how great it was, and how terrible! My doors
          locked, warders to guard them, the hands of my servants searched
          lest one of them should convey to me the most trifling letter from
          my friends, strange servants to wait on me! Only with difficulty
          was I able to bring with me to court four of my own domestics for
          my personal service, two of them mere boys and two older men, of
          whom only one knew of my attitude to the gods, and, as far as he
          was able, secretly joined me in their worship. I had entrusted with
          the care of my books, since he was the only one with me of many
          loyal comrades and friends, a certain physician<a id="noteref_462"

          had been allowed to leave home with me because it was not known
          that he was my friend. And this state of things caused me such
          alarm and I was so apprehensive about it, that though many of my
          friends really wished to visit me, I very reluctantly refused them
          admittance; for though I was most anxious to see them, I shrank
          from bringing disaster upon them and myself at the same time. But
          this is somewhat foreign to my narrative. The following relates to
          the actual course of events.)</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          despatched me into Gaul, which was then in a state of great
          disorder; and I was sent not as commander of the garrisons there
          but rather as a subordinate of the generals there stationed. For

          to watch me as vigilantly as they did the enemy, for far I should
          attempt to cause a revolt. And when all this had happened in the

          there I was exposed to the utmost danger. For I was not even
          allowed to assemble the troops; this power was entrusted to
          another, while I was quartered apart with only a few soldiers, and
          then, since the neighbouring towns begged for my assistance, I
          assigned to them the greater part of the force that I had, and so I
          myself was left isolated. This then was the condition of affairs at

          deprived by him of his command and superseded, I in my turn was
          thought to be by no means capable or talented as a general, merely
          because I had shown myself mild and moderate. For I thought I ought
          not to fight against my yoke or interfere with the general in
          command except when in some very dangerous undertaking I saw either
          that something was being overlooked, or that something was being
          attempted that ought never to have been attempted at all. But after
          certain persons had treated me with disrespect on one or two
          occasions, I decided that for the future I ought to show my own
          self-respect by keeping silence, and henceforth I contented myself
          with parading the imperial robe and the image. For I thought that
          to these at any rate I had been given a right.)</p>

          that so great a transformation would take place in the affairs of

          command of all the forces. And when the grain was ripe I took the
          field; for a great number of Germans had settled themselves with
          impunity near the towns they had sacked in Gaul. Now the number of
          the towns whose walls had been dismantled was about forty-five,
          without counting citadels and smaller forts. And the barbarians
          then controlled on our side of the Rhine the whole country that
          extends from its sources to the Ocean. Moreover those who were
          settled nearest to us were as much as three hundred stades from the
          banks of the Rhine, and a district three times as wide as that had
          been left a desert by their raids; so that the Gauls could not even
          pasture their cattle there. Then too there were certain cities
          deserted by their inhabitants, near which the barbarians were not
          yet encamped. This then was the condition of Gaul when I took it
          over. I recovered the city of Agrippina<a id="noteref_470" name=

          the Rhine which had been taken about ten months earlier, and also
          the neighbouring fort of Argentoratum,<a id="noteref_471" name=

          the foot-hills of the Vosges mountains, and there I engaged the
          enemy not ingloriously. It may be that the fame of that battle has
          reached even your ears. There though the gods gave into my hands as
          prisoner of war the king<a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472"

          the enemy, I did not begrudge Constantius the glory of that
          success. And yet though I was not allowed to triumph for it, I had
          it in my power to slay my enemy, and moreover I could have led him
          through the whole of Gaul and exhibited him to the cities, and thus
          have luxuriated as it were in the misfortunes of Chnodomar. I
          thought it my duty to do none of these things, but sent him at once
          to Constantius who was returning from the country of the Quadi and
          the Sarmatians. So it came about that, though I had done all the
          fighting and he had only travelled in those parts and held friendly
          intercourse with the tribes who dwell on the borders of the Danube,
          it was not I but he who triumphed.)</p>

          the barbarians had been driven out of Gaul, most of the towns had
          been recovered, and a whole fleet of many ships had arrived from
          Britain. I had collected a fleet of six hundred ships, four hundred
          of which I had had built in less than ten months, and I brought
          them all into the Rhine, no slight achievement, on account of the
          neighbouring barbarians who kept attacking me. At least it seemed
          so impossible to Florentius that he had promised to pay the
          barbarians a fee of two thousand pounds weight of silver in return
          for a passage. Constantius when he learned this—for Florentius had
          informed him about the proposed payment—wrote to me to carry out
          the agreement, unless I thought it absolutely disgraceful. But how
          could it fail to be disgraceful when it seemed so even to
          Constantius, who was only too much in the habit of trying to
          conciliate the barbarians? However, no payment was made to them.
          Instead I marched against them, and since the gods protected me and
          were present to aid, I received the submission of part of the
          Salian tribe, and drove out the Chamavi and took many cattle and
          women and children. And I so terrified them all, and made them
          tremble at my approach that I immediately received hostages from
          them and secured a safe passage for my food supplies.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(It would take
          too long to enumerate everything and to write down every detail of
          the task that I accomplished within four years. But to sum it all
          up: Three times, while I was still Caesar, I crossed the Rhine; one
          thousand persons who were held as captives on the further side of
          the Rhine I demanded and received back; in two battles and one
          siege I took captive ten thousand prisoners, and those not of
          unserviceable age but men in the prime of life; I sent to
          Constantius four levies of excellent infantry, three more of
          infantry not so good, and two very distinguished squadrons of
          cavalry. I have now with the help of the gods recovered all the
          towns, and by that time I had already recovered almost forty. I
          call Zeus and all the gods who protect cities and our race to bear
          witness as to my behaviour towards Constantius and my loyalty to
          him, and that I behaved to him as I would have chosen that my own
          son should behave to me.<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475"
          href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a> I
          have paid him more honour than any Caesar has paid to any Emperor
          in the past. Indeed, to this very day he has no accusation to bring
          against me on that score, though I have been entirely frank in my
          dealings with him, but he invents absurd pretexts for his
          resentment. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“You have detained
          Lupicinus and three other men.”</span> And supposing I had even put
          them to death after they had openly plotted against me, he ought
          for the sake of keeping peace to have renounced his resentment at
          their fate. But I did those men not the least injury, and I
          detained them because they are by nature quarrelsome and
          mischief-makers. And though I am spending large sums of the public
          money on them, I have robbed them of none of their property.
          Observe how Constantius really lays down the law that I ought to
          proceed to extremities with such men! For by his anger on behalf of
          men who are not related to him at all, does he not rebuke and
          ridicule me for my folly in having served so faithfully the
          murderer of my father, my brothers, my cousins; the executioner as
          it were of his and my whole family and kindred? Consider too with
          what deference I have continued to treat him even since I became
          Emperor, as is shown in my letters.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And how I
          behaved to him before that you shall now learn. Since I was well
          aware that whenever mistakes were made I alone should incur the
          disgrace and danger, though most of the work was carried on by
          others, I first of all implored him, if he had made up his mind to
          that course and was altogether determined to proclaim me Caesar, to
          give me good and able men to assist me. He however at first gave me
          the vilest wretches. And when one, the most worthless of them, had
          very gladly accepted and no one of the others consented, he gave me
          with a bad grace an officer who was indeed excellent, Sallust, who
          on account of his virtue has at once fallen under his suspicion.
          And since I was not satisfied with such an arrangement and saw how
          his manner to them varied, for I observed that he trusted one of
          them too much and paid no attention at all to the other, I clasped
          his right hand and his knees and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          have no acquaintance with any of these men nor have had in the
          past. But I know them by report, and since you bid me I regard them
          as my comrades and friends and pay them as much respect as I would
          to old acquaintances. Nevertheless it is not just that my affairs
          should be entrusted to them or that their fortunes should be
          hazarded with mine. What then is my petition? Give me some sort of
          written rules as to what I must avoid and what you entrust to me to
          perform. For it is clear that you will approve of him who obeys you
          and punish him who is disobedient, though indeed I am very sure
          that no one will disobey you.”</span>)</p>

          mention the innovations that Pentadius at once tried to introduce.
          But I kept opposing him in everything and for that reason he became
          my enemy. Then Constantius chose another and a second and a third
          and fashioned them for his purpose, I mean Paul and Gaudentius,
          those notorious sycophants; he hired them to attack me and then
          took measures to remove Sallust, because he was my friend, and to
          appoint Lucilianus immediately, as his successor. And a little
          later Florentius also became my enemy on account of his avarice
          which I used to oppose. These men persuaded Constantius, who was
          perhaps already somewhat irritated by jealousy of my successes, to
          remove me altogether from command of the troops. And he wrote
          letters full of insults directed against me and threatening ruin to
          the Gauls. For he gave orders for the withdrawal from Gaul of, I
          might almost say, the whole of the most efficient troops without
          exception, and assigned this commission to Lupicinus and Gintonius,
          while to me he wrote that I must oppose them in nothing.)</p>

          lamentations about his betrayal of the Gauls. Moreover the author
          of the letter lamented bitterly the disgrace inflicted on myself.
          This letter when it arrived provoked all those who were most
          definitely on the side of Constantius to urge me in the strongest
          terms to send away the troops at once, before similar letters could
          be scattered broadcast among the rest of the legions. And indeed
          there was no one there belonging to the party supposed to be
          friendly to me, but only Nebridius, Pentadius, and Decentius, the
          latter of whom had been despatched for this very purpose by
          Constantius. And when I replied that we ought to wait still longer
          for Lupicinus and Florentius, no one listened to me, but they all
          declared that we ought to do the very opposite, unless I wished to
          add this further proof and evidence for the suspicions that were
          already entertained about me. And they added this argument:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“If you send away the troops now it will be
          regarded as your measure, but when the others come Constantius will
          give them not you the credit and you will be held to blame.”</span>
          And so they persuaded or rather compelled me to write to him. For
          he alone may be said to be persuaded who has the power to refuse,
          but those who can use force have no need to persuade as well;<a id=
          "noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a> then
          again where force is used there is no persuasion, but a man is the
          victim of necessity. Thereupon we discussed by which road, since
          there were two, the troops had better march. I preferred that they
          should take one of these, but they immediately compelled them to
          take the other, for fear that the other route if chosen should give
          rise to mutiny among the troops and cause some disturbance, and
          that then, when they had once begun to mutiny, they might throw all
          into confusion. Indeed such apprehension on their part seemed not
          altogether without grounds.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(The legions
          arrived, and I, as was customary, went to meet them and exhorted
          them to continue their march. For one day they halted, and till
          that time I knew nothing whatever of what they had determined; I
          call to witness Zeus, Helios, Ares, Athene, and all the other gods
          that no such suspicion even entered my mind until that very
          evening. It was already late, when about sunset the news was
          brought to me, and suddenly the palace was surrounded and they all
          began to shout aloud, while I was still considering what I ought to
          do and feeling by no means confident. My wife was still alive and
          it happened, that in order to rest alone, I had gone to the upper
          room near hers. Then from there through an opening in the wall I
          prayed to Zeus. And when the shouting grew still louder and all was
          in a tumult in the palace I entreated the god to give me a sign;
          and thereupon he showed me a sign<a id="noteref_483" name=
          "noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a> and
          bade me yield and not oppose myself to the will of the army.
          Nevertheless even after these tokens had been vouchsafed to me I
          did not yield without reluctance, but resisted as long as I could,
          and would not accept either the salutation<a id="noteref_484" name=
          "noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> or
          the diadem. But since I could not singlehanded control so many, and
          moreover the gods, who willed that this should happen, spurred on
          the soldiers and gradually softened my resolution, somewhere about
          the third hour some soldier or other gave me the collar and I put
          it on my head and returned to the palace, as the gods know groaning
          in my heart. And yet surely it was my duty to feel confidence and
          to trust in the god after he had shown me the sign; but I was
          terribly ashamed and ready to sink into the earth at the thought of
          not seeming to obey Constantius faithfully to the last.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now since there
          was the greatest consternation in the palace, the friends of
          Constantius thought they would seize the occasion to contrive a
          plot against me without delay, and they distributed money to the
          soldiers, expecting one of two things, either that they would cause
          dissension between me and the troops, or no doubt that the latter
          would attack me openly. But when a certain officer belonging to
          those who commanded my wife's escort perceived that this was being
          secretly contrived, he first reported it to me and then, when he
          saw that I paid no attention to him, he became frantic, and like
          one possessed he began to cry aloud before the people in the
          market-place, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fellow soldiers, strangers,
          and citizens, do not abandon the Emperor!”</span> Then the soldiers
          were inspired by a frenzy of rage and they all rushed to the palace
          under arms. And when they found me alive, in their delight, like
          men who meet friends whom they had not hoped to see again, they
          pressed round me on this side and on that, and embraced me and
          carried me on their shoulders. And it was a sight worth seeing, for
          they were like men seized with a divine frenzy. Then after they had
          surrounded me on all sides they demanded that I give up to them for
          punishment the friends of Constantius. What fierce opposition I had
          to fight down in my desire to save those persons is known to all
          the gods.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But further,
          how did I behave to Constantius after this? Even to this day I have
          not yet used in my letters to him the title which was bestowed on
          me by the gods, but I have always signed myself Caesar, and I have
          persuaded the soldiers to demand nothing more if only he would
          allow us to dwell peaceably in Gaul and would ratify what has been
          already done. All the legions with me sent letters to him praying
          that there might be harmony between us. But instead of this he let
          loose against us the barbarians, and among them proclaimed me his
          foe and paid them bribes so that the people of the Gauls might be
          laid waste; moreover he wrote to the forces in Italy and bade them
          be on their guard against any who should come from Gaul; and on the
          frontiers of Gaul in the cities near by he ordered to be got ready
          three million bushels of wheat which had been ground at
          Brigantia,<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href=
          "#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> and
          the same amount near the Cottian Alps, with the intention of
          marching to oppose me. These are not mere words but deeds that
          speak plain. In fact the letters that he wrote I obtained from the
          barbarians who brought them to me; and I seized the provisions that
          had been made ready, and the letters of Taurus. Besides, even now
          in his letters he addresses me as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Caesar”</span> and declares that he will never make
          terms with me: but he sent one Epictetus, a bishop of Gaul,<a id=
          "noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> to
          offer a guarantee for my personal safety; and throughout his
          letters he keeps repeating that he will not take my life, but about
          my honour he says not a word. As for his oaths, for my part I think
          they should, as the proverb says, be written in ashes,<a id=
          "noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> so
          little do they inspire belief. But my honour I will not give up,
          partly out of regard for what is seemly and fitting, but also to
          secure the safety of my friends. And I have not yet described the
          cruelty that he is practising over the whole earth.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(These then were
          the events that persuaded me; this was the conduct I thought just.
          And first I imparted it to the gods who see and hear all things.
          Then when I had offered sacrifices for my departure, the omens were
          favourable on that very day on which I was about to announce to the
          troops that they were to march to this place; and since it was not
          only on behalf of my own safety but far more for the sake of the
          general welfare and the freedom of all men and in particular of the
          people of Gaul,—for twice already he had betrayed them to the enemy
          and had not even spared the tombs of their ancestors, he who is so
          anxious to conciliate strangers!—then, I say, I thought that I
          ought to add to my forces certain very powerful tribes and to
          obtain supplies of money, which I had a perfect right to coin, both
          gold and silver. Moreover if even now he would welcome a
          reconciliation with me I would keep to what I at present possess;
          but if he should decide to go to war and will in no wise relent
          from his earlier purpose, then I ought to do and to suffer whatever
          is the will of the gods; seeing that it would be more disgraceful
          to show myself his inferior through failure of courage or lack of
          intelligence than in mere numbers. For if he now defeats me by
          force of numbers that will not be his doing, but will be due to the
          larger army that he has at his command. If on the other hand he had
          surprised me loitering in Gaul and clinging to bare life and, while
          I tried to avoid the danger, had attacked me on all sides, in the
          rear and on the flanks by means of the barbarians, and in front by
          his own legions, I should I believe have had to face complete ruin,
          and moreover the disgrace of such conduct is greater than any
          punishment—at least in the sight of the wise.<a id="noteref_491"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Julian was
          Supreme Pontiff, and as such felt responsible for the teachings and
          conduct of the priesthood. He saw that in order to offset the
          influence of the Christian priests which he thought was partly due
          to their moral teaching, partly to their charity towards the poor,
          the pagans must follow their example. Hitherto the preaching of
          morals had been left to the philosophers. Julian's admonitions as
          to the treatment of the poor and of those in prison, and the rules
          that he lays down for the private life of a priest are evidently
          borrowed from the Christians.</p>

          their king. And the tribe of evil demons is appointed to punish
          those who do not worship the gods, and stung to madness by them

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(You must above
          all exercise philanthropy, for from it result many other blessings,
          and moreover that choicest and greatest blessing of all, the good
          will of the gods. For just as those who are in agreement with their
          masters about their friendships and ambitions and loves are more
          kindly treated than their fellow slaves, so we must suppose that
          God, who naturally loves human beings, has more kindness for those
          men who love their fellows. Now philanthropy has many divisions and
          is of many kinds. For instance it is shown when men are punished in
          moderation with a view to the betterment of those punished, as
          schoolmasters punish children; and again in ministering to men's
          needs, even as the gods minister to our own. You see all the
          blessings of the earth that they have granted to us, food of all
          sorts, and in an abundance that they have not granted to all other
          creatures put together. And since we were born naked they covered
          us with the hair of animals, and with things that grow in the
          ground and on trees. Nor were they content to do this simply or
          off-hand, as Moses tells us men took coats of skins,<a id=

          you see how numerous are the gifts of Athene the Craftswoman. What
          other animals use wine, or olive oil? Except indeed in cases where
          we let them share in these things, even though we do not share them
          with our fellowmen. What creature of the sea uses corn, what land
          animal uses things that grow in the sea? And I have not yet
          mentioned gold and bronze and iron, though in all these the the
          gods have made us very rich; yet not to the end that we may bring
          reproach on them by disregarding the poor who go about in our
          midst, especially when they happen to be of good character—men for
          instance who have inherited no paternal estate, and are poor
          because in the greatness of their souls they have no desire for
          money. Now the crowd when they see such men blame the gods. However
          it is not the gods who are to blame for their poverty, but rather
          the insatiate greed of us men of property becomes the cause of this
          false conception of the gods among men, and besides of unjust blame
          of the gods. Of what use, I ask, is it for us to pray that God will
          rain gold on the poor as he did on the people of Rhodes?<a id=

          even though this should come to pass, we should forthwith set our
          slaves underneath to catch it, and put out vessels everywhere, and
          drive off all comers so that we alone might seize upon the gifts of
          the gods meant for all in common. And anyone would naturally think
          it strange if we should ask for this, which is not in the nature of
          things, and is in every way unprofitable, while we do not do what
          is in our power. Who, I ask, ever became poor by giving to his
          neighbours? Indeed I myself, who have often given lavishly to those
          in need, have recovered my gifts again many times over at the hands
          of the gods, though I am a poor man of business; nor have I ever
          repented of that lavish giving. And of the present time I will say
          nothing, for it would be altogether irrational of me to compare the
          expenditure of private persons with that of an Emperor; but when I
          was myself still a private person I know that this happened to me
          many times. My grandmother's estate for instance was kept for me
          untouched, though others had taken possession of it by violence,
          because from the little that I had I spent money on those in need
          and gave them a share.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(We ought then
          to share our money with all men, but more generously with the good,
          and with the helpless and poor so as to suffice for their need. And
          I will assert, even though it be paradoxical to say so, that it
          would be a pious act to share our clothes and food even with the
          wicked. For it is to the humanity in a man that we give, and not to
          his moral character. Hence I think that even those who are shut up
          in prison have a right to the same sort of care; since this kind of
          philanthropy will not hinder justice. For when many have been shut
          up in prison to await trial, of whom some will be found guilty,
          while others will prove to be innocent, it would be harsh indeed if
          out of regard for the guiltless we should not bestow some pity on
          the guilty also, or again, if on account of the guilty we should
          behave ruthlessly and inhumanly to those also who have done no
          wrong. This too, when I consider it, seems to me altogether wrong;
          I mean that we call Zeus by the title <span class="tei tei-q">“God
          of Strangers,”</span> while we show ourselves more inhospitable to
          strangers than are the very Scythians. How, I ask, can one who
          wishes to sacrifice to Zeus, the God of Strangers, even approach
          his temple? With what conscience can he do so, when he has
          forgotten the saying)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Again, the man
          who worships Zeus the God of Comrades, and who, though he sees his
          neighbours in need of money, does not give them even so much as a
          drachma, how, I say, can he think that he is worshipping Zeus
          aright? When I observe this I am wholly amazed, since I see that
          these titles of the gods are from the beginning of the world their
          express images, yet in our practice we pay no attention to anything
          of the sort. The gods are called by us <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“gods of kindred,”</span> and Zeus the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“God of Kindred,”</span> but we treat our kinsmen as
          though they were strangers. I say <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“kinsmen”</span> because every man, whether he will or
          no, is akin to every other man, whether it be true, as some say,
          that we are all descended from one man and one woman, or whether it
          came about in some other way, and the gods created us all together,
          at the first when the world began, not one man and one woman only,
          but many men and many women at once. For they who had the power to
          create one man and one woman, were able to create many men and
          women at once; since the manner of creating one man and one woman
          is the same as that of creating many men and many women. And<a id=

          must have regard to the differences in our habits and laws, or
          still more to that which is higher and more precious and more
          authoritative, I mean the sacred tradition of the gods which has
          been handed down to us by the theurgists of earlier days, namely
          that when Zeus was setting all things in order there fell from him
          drops of sacred blood, and from them, as they say, arose the race
          of men. It follows therefore that we are all kinsmen, whether, many
          men and women as we are, we come from two human beings, or whether,
          as the gods tell us, and as we ought to believe, since facts bear
          witness thereto, we are all descended from the gods. And that facts
          bear witness that many men came into the world at once, I shall
          maintain elsewhere, and precisely, but for the moment it will be
          enough to say this much, that if we were descended from one man and
          one woman, it is not likely that our laws would show such great
          divergence; nor in any case is it likely that the whole earth was
          filled with people by one man; nay, not even if the women used to
          bear many children at a time to their husbands, like swine. But
          when the gods all together had given birth to men, just as one man
          came forth, so in like manner came forth many men who had been
          allotted to the gods who rule over births; and they brought them
          forth, receiving their souls from the Demiurge from eternity.<a id=

          also to bear in mind how many discourses have been devoted by men
          in the past to show that man is by nature a social animal. And
          shall we, after, asserting this and enjoining it, bear ourselves
          unsociably to our neighbours? Then let everyone make the basis of
          his conduct moral virtues, and actions like these, namely reverence
          towards the gods, benevolence towards men, personal chastity; and
          thus let him abound in pious acts, I mean by endeavouring always to
          have pious thoughts about the gods, and by regarding the temples
          and images of the gods with due honour and veneration, and by
          worshipping the gods as though he saw them actually present. For
          our fathers established images and altars, and the maintenance of
          undying fire, and, generally speaking, everything of the sort, as
          symbols of the presence of the gods, not that we may regard such
          things as gods, but that we may worship the gods through them. For
          since being in the body it was in bodily wise that we must needs
          perform our service to the gods also, though they are themselves
          without bodies; they therefore revealed to us in the earliest
          images the class of gods next in rank to the first, even those that
          revolve in a circle about the whole heavens. But since not even to
          these can due worship be offered in bodily wise—for they are by

          class of images was invented on the earth, and by performing our
          worship to them we shall make the gods propitious to ourselves. For
          just as those who make offerings to the statues of the emperors,
          who are in need of nothing, nevertheless induce goodwill towards
          themselves thereby, so too those who make offerings to the images
          of the gods, though the gods need nothing, do nevertheless thereby
          persuade them to help and to care for them. For zeal to do all that
          is in one's power is, in truth, a proof of piety, and it is evident
          that he who abounds in such zeal thereby displays a higher degree
          of piety; whereas he who neglects what is possible, and then
          pretends to aim at what is impossible, evidently does not strive
          after the impossible, since he overlooks the possible. For even
          though God stands in need of nothing, it does not follow that on
          that account nothing ought to be offered to him. He does not need
          the reverence that is paid in words. What then? Is it rational to
          deprive him of this also? By no means. It follows then that one
          ought not to deprive him either of the honour that is paid to him
          through deeds, an honour which not three years or three thousand
          years have ordained, but all past time among all the nations of the
          earth.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Therefore, when
          we look at the images of the gods, let us not indeed think they are
          stones or wood, but neither let us think they are the gods
          themselves; and indeed we do not say that the statues of the
          emperors are mere wood and stone and bronze, but still less do we
          say they are the emperors themselves. He therefore who loves the
          emperor delights to see the emperor's statue, and he who loves his
          son delights to see his son's statue, and he who loves his father
          delights to see his father's statue. It follows that he who loves
          the gods delights to gaze on the images of the gods, and their
          likenesses, and he feels reverence and shudders with awe of the
          gods who look at him from the unseen world. Therefore if any man
          thinks that because they have once been called likenesses of the
          gods, they are incapable of being destroyed, he is, it seems to me,
          altogether foolish; for surely in that case they were incapable of
          being made by men's hands. But what has been made by a wise and
          good man can be destroyed by a bad and ignorant man. But those
          beings which were fashioned by the gods as the living images of
          their invisible nature, I mean the gods who revolve in a circle in
          the heavens, abide imperishable for all time. Therefore let no man
          disbelieve in gods because he sees and hears that certain persons
          have profaned their images and temples. Have they not in many cases
          put good men to death, like Socrates and Dio and the great
          Empedotimus?<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a> And
          yet I am very sure that the gods cared more for these men than for
          the temples. But observe that since they knew that the bodies even
          of these men were destructible, they allowed them to yield to
          nature and to submit, but later on they exacted punishment from
          their slayers; and this has happened in the sight of all, in our
          own day also, in the case of all who have profaned the
          temples.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Therefore let
          no man deceive us with his sayings or trouble our faith in a divine
          providence. For as for those who make such profanation a reproach
          against us, I mean the prophets of the Jews, what have they to say
          about their own temple, which was overthrown three times and even
          now is not being raised up again? This I mention not as a reproach
          against them, for I myself, after so great a lapse of time,
          intended to restore it, in honour of the god whose name has been
          associated with it. But in the present case I have used this
          instance because I wish to prove that nothing made by man can be
          indestructible and that those prophets who wrote such statements
          were uttering nonsense, due to their gossiping with silly old
          women. In my opinion there is no reason why their god should not be
          a mighty god, even though he does not happen to have wise prophets
          or interpreters. But the real reason why they are not wise is that
          they have not submitted their souls to be cleansed by the regular
          course of study, nor have they allowed those studies to open their
          tightly closed eyes, and to clear away the mist that hangs over
          them. But since these men see as it were a great light through a
          fog, not plainly or clearly, and since they think that what they
          see is not a pure light but a fire, and they fail to discern all
          that surrounds it, they cry with a loud voice: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tremble, be afraid, fire, flame, death, a dagger, a
          broad-sword!”</span> thus describing under many names the harmful
          might of fire. But on this subject it will be better to demonstrate
          separately how much inferior to our own poets are these teachers of
          tales about the gods.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(It is our duty
          to adore not only the images of the gods, but also their temples
          and sacred precincts and altars. And it is reasonable to honour the
          priests also as officials and servants of the gods; and because
          they minister to us what concerns the gods, and they lend strength
          to the gods' gift of good things to us; for they sacrifice and pray
          on behalf of all men. It is therefore right that we should pay them
          all not less, if not indeed more, than the honours that we pay to
          the magistrates of the state. And if any one thinks that we ought
          to assign equal honours to them and to the magistrates of the
          state, since the latter also are in some sort dedicated to the
          service of the gods, as being guardians of the laws, nevertheless
          we ought at any rate to give the priests a far greater share of our
          good will. The Achaeans, for instance, enjoined on their king<a id=

          reverence the priest, though he was one of the enemy, whereas we do
          not even reverence the priests who are our friends, and who pray
          and sacrifice on our behalf.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(But since my
          discourse has come back again to the beginning as I have so long
          wished, I think it is worth while for me to describe next in order
          what sort of man a priest ought to be, in order that he may justly
          be honoured himself and may cause the gods to be honoured. For as
          for us, we ought not to investigate or enquire as to his conduct,
          but so long as a man is called a priest we ought to honour and
          cherish him, but if he prove to be wicked we ought to allow his
          priestly office to be taken away from him, since he has shown
          himself unworthy of it. But so long as he sacrifices for us and
          makes offerings and stands in the presence of the gods, we must
          regard him with respect and reverence as the most highly honoured
          chattel<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href=
          "#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a> of
          the gods. For it would be absurd for us to pay respect to the very
          stones of which the altars are made, on account of their being
          dedicated to the gods, because they have a certain shape and form
          suited to the ritual for which they have been fashioned, and then
          not to think that we ought to honour a man who has been dedicated
          to the gods. Perhaps someone will object—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But suppose he does wrong and often fails to offer to
          the gods their sacred rites?”</span> Then indeed I answer that we
          ought to convict a man of that sort, so that he may not by
          wickedness offend the gods; but that we ought not to dishonour him
          until he has been convicted. Nor indeed is it reasonable that when
          we have set our hands to this business, we should take away their
          honour not only from these offenders but also from those who are
          worthy to be honoured. Then let every priest, like every
          magistrate, be treated with respect, since there is also an oracle
          to that effect from the Didymaean god:<a id="noteref_516" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now though
          there are many utterances of the god to the same effect, by means
          of which we may learn to honour and cherish priests as we ought, I
          shall speak on this subject elsewhere at greater length. But for
          the present it is enough to point out that I am not inventing
          anything offhand, since I think that the declaration made by the
          god and the injunction expressed in his own words are sufficient.
          Therefore let any man who considers that as a teacher of such
          matters I am worthy to be believed show due respect to the god and
          obey him, and honour the priests of the gods above all other men.
          And now I will try to describe what sort of man a priest himself
          ought to be, though not for your especial benefit. For if I did not
          already know from the evidence both of the high priest and of the
          most mighty gods that you administer this priestly office aright—at
          least all matters that come under your management—I should not have
          ventured to confide to you a matter so important. But I do so in
          order that you may be able from what I say to instruct the other
          priests, not only in the cities but in the country districts also,
          more convincingly and with complete freedom; since not of your own
          self do you alone devise these precepts and practise them, but you
          have me also to give you support, who by the grace of the gods am
          known as sovereign pontiff, though I am indeed by no means worthy
          of so high an office; though I desire, and moreover constantly pray
          to the gods that I may be worthy. For the gods, you must know, hold
          out great hopes for us after death; and we must believe them
          absolutely. For they are always truthful, not only about the future
          life, but about the affairs of this life also. And since in the
          superabundance of their power they are able both to overcome the
          confusion that exists in this life and to regulate its disorders
          and irregularities, will they not all the more in that other life
          where conflicting things are reconciled, after the immortal soul
          has been separated from the body and the lifeless body has turned
          to earth, be able to bestow all those things for which they have
          held out hopes to mankind? Therefore since we know that the gods
          have granted to their priests a great recompense, let us make them
          responsible in all things for men's esteem of the gods, displaying
          their own lives as an example of what they ought to preach to the
          people.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ἀρκτέον δὲ ἡμῖν
          τῆς πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς εὐσεβείας. οὕτω γὰρ ἡμᾶς πρέπει τοῖς θεοῖς

          we ought to preach is reverence towards the gods. For it is fitting
          that we should perform our service to the gods as though they were
          themselves present with us and beheld us, and though not seen by us
          could direct their gaze, which is more powerful than any light,
          even as far as our hidden thoughts. And this saying is not my

          the god's, and has been declared in many utterances, but for me
          surely it is sufficient, by bringing forth one such utterance, to
          illustrate two things in one, namely how the gods see all things
          and how they rejoice in god-fearing men:)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now in so far
          as all soul, but in a much higher degree the soul of man, is akin
          to and related to the gods, so much the more is it likely that the
          gaze of the gods should penetrate through his soul easily and
          effectively. And observe the love of the god for mankind when he
          says that he delights in the disposition of god-fearing men as much
          as in Olympus most pure and bright. How then shall he not lead up
          our souls from the darkness and from Tartarus, if we approach him
          with pious awe? And indeed he has knowledge even of those who have
          been imprisoned in Tartarus—for not even that region falls outside
          the power of the gods,—and to the god-fearing he promises Olympus
          instead of Tartarus. Wherefore we ought by all means to hold fast
          to deeds of piety, approaching the gods with reverence, and neither
          saying nor listening to anything base. And the priests ought to
          keep themselves pure not only from impure or shameful acts, but
          also from uttering words and hearing speeches of that character.
          Accordingly we must banish all offensive jests and all licentious
          intercourse. And that you may understand what I mean by this, let
          no one who has been consecrated a priest read either Archilochus or
          Hipponax<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href=
          "#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> or
          anyone else who writes such poems as theirs. And in Old Comedy let
          him avoid everything of that type—for it is better so—and indeed on
          all accounts philosophy alone will be appropriate for us priests;
          and of philosophers only those who chose the gods as guides of
          their mental discipline, like Pythagoras and Plato and Aristotle,
          and the school of Chrysippus and Zeno. For we ought not to give
          heed to them all nor to the doctrines of all, but only to those
          philosophers and those of their doctrines that make men
          god-fearing, and teach concerning the gods, first that they exist,
          secondly that they concern themselves with the things of this
          world, and further that they do no injury at all either to mankind
          or to one another out of jealousy or envy or enmity. I mean the
          sort of thing our poets in the first place have brought themselves
          into disrepute by writing, and in the second place such tales as
          the prophets of the Jews take pains to invent, and are admired for
          so doing by those miserable men who have attached themselves to the
          Galilaeans.)</p>

          will be appropriate to read such narratives as have been composed
          about deeds that have actually been done; but we must avoid all
          fictions in the form of narrative such as were circulated among men
          in the past, for instance tales whose theme is love, and generally
          speaking everything of that sort. For just as not every road is
          suitable for consecrated priests, but the roads they travel ought
          to be duly assigned, so not every sort of reading is suitable for a
          priest. For words breed a certain sort of disposition in the soul,
          and little by little it arouses desires, and then on a sudden
          kindles a terrible blaze, against which one ought, in my opinion,
          to arm oneself well in advance.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Let us not
          admit discourses by Epicurus or Pyrrho; but indeed the gods have
          already in their wisdom destroyed their works, so that most of
          their books have ceased to be. Nevertheless there is no reason why
          I should not, by way of example, mention these works too, to show
          what sort of discourses priests must especially avoid; and if such
          discourses, then much more must they avoid such thoughts. For an
          error of speech is, in my opinion, by no means the same as an error
          of the mind, but we ought to give heed to the mind first of all,
          since the tongue sins in company with it. We ought to learn by
          heart the hymns in honour of the gods—many and beautiful they are,
          composed by men of old and of our own time—though indeed we ought
          to try to know also those which are being sung in the temples. For
          the greater number were bestowed on us by the gods themselves, in
          answer to prayer, though some few also were written by men, and
          were composed in honour of the gods by the aid of divine
          inspiration and a soul inaccessible to things evil.)</p>

          least, we ought to study to do, and we ought also to pray often to
          the gods, both in private and in public, if possible three times a
          day, but if not so often, certainly at dawn and in the evening. For
          it is not meet that a consecrated priest should pass a day or a
          night without sacrifice; and dawn is the beginning of the day as
          twilight is of the night. And it is proper to begin both periods
          with sacrifice to the gods, even when we happen not to be assigned
          to perform the service. For it is our duty to maintain all the
          ritual of the temples that the law of our fathers prescribes, and
          we ought to perform neither more nor less than that ritual; for
          eternal are the gods, so that we too ought to imitate their
          essential nature in order that thereby we may make them
          propitious.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now if we were
          pure soul alone, and our bodies did not hinder us in any respect,
          it would be well to prescribe one sort of life for priests. But
          since what he should practise when on duty concerns the individual
          priest alone, not priests absolutely, what should we concede to a
          man who has received the office of priest, on occasions when he is
          not actually engaged in service in the temples? I think that a
          priest ought to keep himself pure from all contamination, for a
          night and a day, and then after purifying himself for another night
          following on the first, with such rites of purification as the
          sacred laws prescribe, he should under these conditions enter the
          temple and remain there for as many days as the law commands.
          (Thirty is the number with us at Rome, but in other places the
          number varies.) It is proper then, I think, that he should remain
          throughout all these days in the sacred precincts, devoting himself
          to philosophy, and that he should not enter a house or a
          market-place, or see even a magistrate, except in the precincts,
          but should concern himself with his service to the god, overseeing
          and arranging everything in person; and then, when he has completed
          the term of days, he should retire from his office in favour of
          another. And when he turns again to the ordinary life of mankind,
          he may be allowed to visit a friend's house, and, when invited, to
          attend a feast, but not on the invitation of all but only of
          persons of the highest character. And at this time there would be
          nothing out of the way in his going occasionally to the
          market-place and conversing with the governor or the chief
          magistrate of his tribe, and giving aid, as far as lies in his
          power, to those who have a good reason for needing it.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(And it is in my
          opinion fitting for priests to wear the most magnificent dress when
          they are within the temple performing the services, but when they
          are outside the sacred precincts to wear ordinary dress, without
          any extravagance. For it is not rational that we should misuse, in
          empty conceit and vain ostentation, what has been given to us for
          the honour of the gods. And for this reason we ought in the market
          place to abstain from too costly dress and from outward show, and
          in a word from every sort of pretentiousness. For consider how the
          gods, because they admired the perfect moderation of
          Amphiaraus,<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href=
          "#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a> after
          they had decreed the destruction of that famous army—and he, though
          he knew that it would be so, went with the expedition and therefore
          did not escape his fated end,—the gods I say transformed him
          completely from what he had been, and removed him to the sphere of
          the gods. For all the others who were in the expedition against
          Thebes engraved a device on their shields before they had conquered
          the enemy, and erected trophies to celebrate the downfall of the
          Cadmeans; but he, the associate of the gods, when he went to war
          had arms with no device; but gentleness he had, and moderation, as
          even the enemy bore witness. Hence I think that we priests ought to
          show moderation in our dress, in order that we may win the goodwill
          of the gods, since it is no slight offence that we commit against
          them when we wear in public the sacred dress and make it public
          property, and in a word give all men an opportunity to stare at it
          as though it were something marvellous. For whenever this happens,
          many who are not purified come near us, and by this means the
          symbols of the gods are polluted. Moreover what lawlessness it is,
          what arrogance towards the gods for us ourselves when we are not
          living the priestly life to wear the priestly dress! However, of
          this too I shall speak more particularly in another place; and what
          I am writing to you at the moment is only a mere outline of the
          subject.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(No priest must
          anywhere be present at the licentious theatrical shows of the
          present day, nor introduce one into his own house; for that is
          altogether unfitting. Indeed if it were possible to banish such
          shows absolutely from the theatres so as to restore to Dionysus
          those theatres pure as of old, I should certainly have endeavoured
          with all my heart to bring this about; but as it is, since I
          thought that this is impossible, and that even if it should prove
          to be possible it would not on other accounts be expedient, I
          forebore entirely from this ambition. But I do demand that priests
          should withdraw themselves from the licentiousness of the theatres
          and leave them to the crowd. Therefore let no priest enter a
          theatre or have an actor or a chariot-driver for his friend; and
          let no dancer or mime even approach his door. And as for the sacred
          games, I permit anyone who will to attend those only in which women
          are forbidden not only to compete but even to be spectators. With
          regard to the hunting shows with dogs which are performed in the
          cities inside the theatres, need I say that not only priests but
          even the sons of priests must keep away from them?)</p>

          perhaps have been well to say earlier from what class of men and by
          what method priests must be appointed; but it is quite appropriate
          that my remarks should end with this. I say that the most upright
          men in every city, by preference those who show most love for the
          gods, and next those who show most love for their fellow men, must
          be appointed, whether they be poor or rich. And in this matter let
          there be no distinction whatever whether they are unknown or well
          known. For the man who by reason of his gentleness has not won
          notice ought not to be barred by reason of his want of fame. Even
          though he be poor and a man of the people, if he possess within
          himself these two things, love for God and love for his fellow men,
          let him be appointed priest. And a proof of his love for God is his
          inducing his own people to show reverence to the gods; a proof of
          his love for his fellows is his sharing cheerfully, even from a
          small store, with those in need, and his giving willingly thereof,
          and trying to do good to as many men as he is able.)</p>

          For when it came about that the poor were neglected and overlooked

          fact and devoted themselves to philanthropy. And they have gained
          ascendancy in the worst of their deeds through the credit they win
          for such practices. For just as those who entice children with a
          cake, and by throwing it to them two or three times induce them to
          follow them, and then, when they are far away from their friends
          cast them on board a ship and sell them as slaves, and that which
          for the moment seemed sweet, proves to be bitter for all the rest
          of their lives—by the same method, I say, the Galilaeans also begin
          with their so-called love-feast, or hospitality, or service of
          tables,—for they have many ways of carrying it out and hence call
          it by many names,—the result is that they have led very many into

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogues

          its excess of radiance as from the sun when one gazes too intently
          at his disc. The couch of Zeus was more brilliant than silver, but

          that it transcended description, and must be comprehended by the
          eye of the mind; for in words it was hard to portray and impossible
          to convey to mortal ears. Never indeed will there be or appear an
          orator so gifted that he could describe such surpassing beauty as

          correctly, no doubt instructed by the Muses themselves, every god
          has his seat on which it is irrevocably ordained that he shall sit,
          firmly and immovably fixed; and though they rise on the entrance of
          their father they never confound or change the order of their seats
          or infringe on one another's, since every one knows his appointed
          place. Now when the gods were seated in a circle, Silenus, amorous,
          methinks, of Dionysus ever fair and ever young, who sat close to
          Zeus his father, took his seat next to him on the pretext that he
          had brought him up and was his tutor. And since Dionysus loves
          jesting and laughter and is the giver of the Graces, Silenus
          diverted the god with a continual flow of sarcasms and jests, and
          in other ways besides.)</p>

          beautiful to behold; for even old age can be radiantly beautiful.

          Silenus when he saw him said, <span class="tei tei-q">“What think

          Silenus scowled horribly because he could not jeer or scoff at

          that he mourned the latter beyond what was becoming, especially
          considering that she was not even a virtuous woman; and he failed
          to see that his son was ruining the empire as well as himself, and
          that though Verus had an excellent son-in-law who would have
          administered the state better, and besides would have managed the
          youth better than he could manage himself. But though he refused to
          ignore these errors he reverenced the exalted virtue of Verus. His
          son however he considered not worth even ridicule and so let him

          latter held one another by the hand and did not walk alongside of
          Diocletian, but formed a sort of chorus round him. And when they
          wished to run before him as a bodyguard he prevented them, since he
          did not think himself entitled to more privileges than they. But
          when he realised that he was growing weary he gave over to them all
          the burdens that he carried on his shoulders, and thereafter walked
          with greater ease. The gods admired their unanimity and permitted
          them to sit far in front of many of their predecessors. Maximian
          was so grossly intemperate that Silenus wasted no jests on him, and
          he was not allowed to join the emperors at their feast. For not
          only did he indulge in vicious passions of all sorts, but proved
          meddlesome and disloyal and often introduced discord into that
          harmonious quartette. Justice therefore banished him without more
          ado. So he went I know not whither, for I forgot to interrogate
          Hermes on this point. However into that harmonious symphony of four
          there crept a terribly harsh and discordant strain. For this reason
          Justice would not suffer the two<a id="noteref_600" name=

          Licinius, he came as far as the door, but as his misdeeds were many
          and monstrous Minos forthwith drove him away. Constantine however
          entered and sat some time, and then came his sons.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(When the feast
          had been prepared as I have described, the gods lacked nothing,
          since all things are theirs. Then Hermes proposed to examine the
          heroes personally and Zeus was of the same mind. Quirinus thereupon
          begged that he might summon one of their number to his side.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Quirinus,”</span> said Heracles,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not have it. For why did you not
          invite to the feast my beloved Alexander also? Zeus, if you are
          minded to introduce into our presence any of these Emperors, send,
          I beg of you, for Alexander. For if we are to examine into the
          merits of men generally, why do we not throw open the competition
          to the better man?”</span> Zeus considered that what the son of
          Alcmena said was only just. So Alexander joined the company of
          heroes, but neither Caesar nor anyone else yielded his place to
          him. However he found and took a vacant seat which the son<a id=

          Severus had taken for himself—he had been expelled for fratricide.
          Then Silenus began to rally Quirinus and said, <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“By Zeus,”</span> retorted Quirinus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I consider that many of them are as good
          as he! It is true that my descendants have admired him so much that
          they hold that he alone of all foreign generals is worthy to be
          styled <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Great.’</span> But it does not
          follow that they think him greater than their own heroes; which may
          be due to national prejudice, but again they may be right. However,
          that we shall very soon find out by examining these men.”</span>
          Even as he spoke Quirinus was blushing, and was evidently extremely
          anxious on behalf of his descendants and feared that they might
          come off with the second prize.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Then Zeus asked
          the gods whether it would be better to summon all the Emperors to
          enter the lists, or whether they should follow the custom of
          athletic contests, which is that he who defeats the winner of many
          victories, though he overcome only that one competitor is held
          thereby to have proved himself superior to all who have been
          previously defeated, and that too though they have not wrestled
          with the winner, but only shown themselves inferior to an
          antagonist who has been defeated. All the gods agreed that this was
          a very suitable sort of test. Hermes then summoned Caesar to appear
          before them, then Octavian, and thirdly Trajan, as being the
          greatest warriors. In the silence that followed, Kronos turned to
          Zeus and said that he was astonished to see that only martial
          Emperors were summoned to the competition, and not a single
          philosopher. <span class="tei tei-q">“For my part,”</span> he
          added, <span class="tei tei-q">“I like philosophers just as well.
          So tell Marcus<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href=
          "#note_608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a> to
          come in too.”</span> Accordingly Marcus was summoned and came in
          looking excessively dignified and showing the effect of his studies
          in the expression of his eyes and his lined brows. His aspect was
          unutterably beautiful from the very fact that he was careless of
          his appearance and unadorned by art; for he wore a very long beard,
          his dress was plain and sober, and from lack of nourishment his
          body was very shining and transparent, like light most pure and
          stainless. When he too had entered the sacred enclosure, Dionysus
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“King Kronos and Father Zeus, can any
          incompleteness exist among the gods?”</span> And when they replied
          that it could not, <span class="tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“let us bring in here some votary of
          pleasure as well.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span>
          answered Zeus, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is not permitted that
          any man should enter here who does not model himself on us.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“In that case,”</span> said Dionysus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“let them be tried at the entrance. Let us
          summon by your leave a man not unwarlike but a slave to pleasure
          and enjoyment. Let Constantine come as far as the door.”</span>
          When this had been agreed upon, opinions were offered as to the
          manner in which they were to compete. Hermes thought that everyone
          ought to speak for himself in turn, and then the gods should vote.
          But Apollo did not approve of this plan, because he said the gods
          ought to test and examine the truth and not plausible rhetoric and
          the devices of the orator. Zeus wished to please them both and at
          the same time to prolong the assembly, so he said, <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(While Hermes
          had been making this proclamation the lots were being drawn, and it
          happened that the first lot favoured Caesar's passion for being
          first. This made him triumphant and prouder than before. But the
          effect on Alexander was that he almost withdrew from the
          competition, had not mighty Heracles encouraged him and prevented
          him from leaving. Alexander drew the lot to speak second, but the
          lots of those who came next coincided with the order in which they
          had lived. Caesar then began as follows: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It was my fortune, O Zeus and ye other gods, to be
          born, following a number of great men, in a city so illustrious
          that she rules more subjects than any other city has ever ruled;
          and indeed other cities are well pleased to rank as second to
          her.<a id="noteref_614" name="noteref_614" href=

          other city, I ask, began with three thousand citizens and in less
          than six centuries carried her victorious arms to the ends of the
          earth? What other nations ever produced so many brave and warlike
          men or such lawgivers? What nation ever honoured the gods as they
          did? Observe then that, though I was born in a city so powerful and
          so illustrious, my achievements not only surpassed the men of my
          own day, but all the heroes who ever lived. As for my
          fellow-citizens I am confident that there is none who will
          challenge my superiority. But if Alexander here is so presumptuous,
          which of his deeds does he pretend to compare with mine? His
          Persian conquests, perhaps, as though he had never seen all those
          trophies that I gathered when I defeated Pompey! And pray, who was
          the more skilful general, Darius or Pompey? Which of them led the
          bravest troops? Pompey had in his army the most martial of the
          nations formerly subject to Darius,<a id="noteref_615" name=
          "noteref_615" href="#note_615"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a> but
          he reckoned them no better than Carians,<a id="noteref_616" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">616</span></span></a> for
          he led also those European forces which had often repulsed all Asia
          when she invaded Europe, aye and he had the bravest of them all,
          Italians, Illyrians, and Celts. And since I have mentioned the
          Celts, shall we compare the exploits of Alexander against the Getae
          with my conquest of Gaul? He crossed the Danube once, I crossed the
          Rhine twice. The German conquest again is all my doing. No one
          opposed Alexander, but I had to contend against Ariovistus. I was
          the first Roman who ventured to sail the outer sea.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a>
          Perhaps this achievement was not so wonderful, though it was a
          daring deed that may well command your admiration; but a more
          glorious action of mine was when I leapt ashore from my ship before
          all the others.<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618" href=
          "#note_618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">618</span></span></a> Of
          the Helvetians and Iberians I say nothing. And still I have said
          not a word about my campaigns in Gaul, when I conquered more than
          three hundred cities and no less than two million men! But great as
          were these achievements of mine, that which followed was still
          greater and more daring. For I had to contend against my fellow
          citizens themselves, and to subdue the invincible, the
          unconquerable Romans. Again, if we are judged by the number of our
          battles, I fought three times as many as Alexander, even reckoning
          by the boasts of those who embellish his exploits. If one counts
          the cities captured, I reduced the greatest number, not only in
          Asia but in Europe as well. Alexander only visited Egypt as a
          sight-seer, but I conquered her while I was arranging
          drinking-parties. Are you pleased to inquire which of us showed
          more clemency after victory? I forgave even my enemies, and for
          what I suffered in consequence at their hands Justice has taken
          vengeance. But Alexander did not even spare his friends, much less
          his enemies. And are you still capable of disputing the first prize
          with me? Then since you will not, like the others, yield place to
          me, you compel me to say that whereas I was humane towards the
          Helvetians you treated the Thebans cruelly. You burned their cities
          to the ground, but I restored the cities that had been burned by
          their own inhabitants. And indeed it was not at all the same thing
          to subdue ten thousand Greeks, and to withstand the onset of a
          hundred and fifty thousand men. Much more could I add both about
          myself and Alexander, but I have not had leisure to practise public
          speaking. Wherefore you ought to pardon me, but from what I have
          said and with regard to what I have not said, you ought, forming
          that decision which equity and justice require, to award me the
          first prize.”</span>)</p>

          spoken to this effect he still wished to go on talking, but
          Alexander, who had with difficulty restrained himself hitherto, now
          lost patience, and with some agitation and combativeness:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          become him perhaps to refrain from both, since both are alike
          insupportable, but especially from disparaging my conduct, the more
          since he imitated it. But he has arrived at such a pitch of
          impudence that he dares to ridicule the model of his own exploits.

          They were themselves the creators and artificers of their schemes

          in all respects was more of a fox than a lion. When he was deserted
          by Fortune who had so long favoured him, you easily overcame him,
          thus unaided. And it is evident that it was not to any superior

          small blunder for a general to make, as I need not tell you—you
          fought a battle and were beaten. And if from imprudence or lack of
          judgment or inability to control his countrymen Pompey neither

          they were well and wisely equipped, had to submit to my valour. And
          since it becomes a virtuous man and a king to pride himself not
          merely on his exploits but also on the justice of those exploits,
          it was on behalf of the Greeks that I took vengeance on the
          Persians, and when I made war on the Greeks it was not because I
          wished to injure Greece, but only to chastise those who tried to
          prevent me from marching through and from calling the Persians to
          account. You, however, while you subdued the Germans and Gauls were
          preparing to fight against your fatherland. What could be worse or
          more infamous? And since you have alluded as though insultingly to
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘ten thousand Greeks,’</span> I am aware
          that you Romans are yourselves descended from the Greeks, and that
          the greater part of Italy was colonised by Greeks; however on that
          fact I do not insist. But at any rate did not you Romans think it
          very important to have as friends and allies one insignificant
          tribe of those very Greeks, I mean the Aetolians, my neighbours?
          And later, when you had gone to war with them for whatever reason,
          did you not have great trouble in making them obey you? Well then,
          if in the old age, as one may say, of Greece, you were barely able
          to reduce not the whole nation but an insignificant state which was
          hardly heard of when Greece was in her prime, what would have
          happened to you if you had had to contend against the Greeks when
          they were in full vigour and united? You know how cowed you were
          when Pyrrhus crossed to invade you. And if you think the conquest
          of Persia such a trifle and disparage an achievement so glorious,
          tell me why, after a war of more than three hundred years, you
          Romans have never conquered a small province beyond the Tigris
          which is still governed by the Parthians? Shall I tell you why? It
          was the arrows of the Persians that checked you. Ask Antony to give
          you an account of them, since he was trained for war by you. I, on
          the other hand, in less than ten years conquered not only Persia
          but India too. After that do you dare to dispute the prize with me,
          who from childhood have commanded armies, whose exploits have been
          so glorious that the memory of them—though they have not been

          attendant carried the water-clock to Octavian, but gave him a

          conducted successful campaigns against the Germans. When I became

          Sextus, Pompey's son, was a mere incident in my campaign. I showed

          instead of resenting it I was delighted with it and revered the man
          as my preceptor, or rather as though he were my own father.

          counted my friend and close companion, and in short I was never
          guilty of any offence against philosophy. But since I saw that more
          than once Rome had been brought to the verge of ruin by internal
          quarrels, I so administered her affairs as to make her strong as
          adamant for all time, unless indeed, O ye gods, you will otherwise.
          For I did not give way to boundless ambition and aim at enlarging
          her empire at all costs, but assigned for it two boundaries defined
          as it were by nature herself, the Danube and the Euphrates. Then
          after conquering the Scythians and Thracians I did not employ the
          long reign that you gods vouchsafed me in making projects for war
          after war, but devoted my leisure to legislation and to reforming
          the evils that war had caused. For in this I thought that I was no
          less well advised than my predecessors, or rather, if I may make
          bold to say so, I was better advised than any who have ever
          administered so great an empire. For some of these, when they might
          have remained quiet and not taken the field, kept making one war an
          excuse for the next, like quarrelsome people and their lawsuits;
          and so they perished in their campaigns. Others when they had a war
          on their hands gave themselves up to indulgence, and preferred such
          base indulgence not only to future glory but even to their personal
          safety. When I reflect on all this I do not think myself entitled

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Trajan was
          allowed to speak next. Though he had some talent for oratory he was
          so lazy that he had been in the habit of letting Sura write most of
          his speeches for him; so he shouted rather than spoke, and
          meanwhile displayed to the gods his Getic and Parthian trophies,
          while he accused his old age of not having allowed him to extend
          his Parthian conquests. <span class="tei tei-q">“You cannot take us
          in,”</span> said Silenus; <span class="tei tei-q">“you reigned
          twenty years and Alexander here only twelve. Why then do you not
          put it down to your own love of ease, instead of complaining of
          your short allowance of time?”</span> Stung by the taunt, since he
          was not deficient in eloquence, though intemperance often made him
          seem more stupid than he was, Trajan began again. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Zeus and ye other gods, when I took over the empire
          it was in a sort of lethargy and much disordered by the tyranny
          that had long prevailed at home, and by the insolent conduct of the
          Getae. I alone ventured to attack the tribes beyond the Danube, and
          I subdued the Getae, the most warlike race that ever existed, which
          is due partly to their physical courage, partly to the doctrines
          that they have adopted from their admired Zamolxis.<a id=

          they believe that they do not die but only change their place of
          abode, and they meet death more readily than other men undertake a
          journey. Yet I accomplished that task in a matter of five years or
          so. That of all the Emperors who came before me<a id="noteref_645"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">645</span></span></a> I was
          regarded as the mildest in the treatment of my subjects, is, I
          imagine, obvious, and neither Caesar here nor any other will
          dispute it with me. Against the Parthians I thought I ought not to
          employ force until they had put themselves in the wrong, but when
          they did so I marched against them, undeterred by my age, though
          the laws would have allowed me to quit the service. Since then the
          facts are as I have said, do I not deserve to be honoured before
          all the rest, first because I was so mild to my subjects, secondly
          because more than others I inspired terror in my country's foes,
          thirdly because I revered your daughter divine Philosophy?”</span>
          When Trajan had finished this speech the gods decided that he
          excelled all the rest in clemency; and evidently this was a virtue
          peculiarly pleasing to them.)</p>

          poor creature and enfeebled by old age, while both were alike
          odious to gods and men. Moreover his campaigns against the
          barbarians covered him with ridicule. For he paid them tribute, so
          to speak, while he gave all his attention to Pleasure, who stood at
          a distance from the gods near the entrance to the moon. Of her
          indeed he was so enamoured that he had no eyes for anything else,
          and cared not at all for victory. However, as it was his turn and
          he had to say something, he began: <span class="tei tei-q">“In the
          following respects I am superior to these others; to the Macedonian
          in having fought against Romans, Germans and Scythians, instead of
          Asiatic barbarians; to Caesar and Octavian in that I did not, like
          them, lead a revolution against brave and good citizens, but
          attacked only the most cruel and wicked tyrants. As for Trajan, I
          should naturally rank higher on account of those same glorious
          exploits against the tyrants, while it would be only fair to regard
          me as his equal on the score of that territory which he added to
          the empire, and I recovered; if indeed it be not more glorious to
          regain than to gain. As for Marcus here, by saying nothing for
          himself he yields precedency to all of us.”</span> <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Silence was
          then proclaimed, and the Emperors thought they had only to wait
          till the gods decided to whom they would vote the first prize. But
          the latter agreed that they must bring to light the motives that
          had governed each, and not judge them by their actions alone, since
          Fortune had the greatest share in these. That goddess herself was
          standing near and kept reproaching all of them, with the single
          exception of Octavian; he, she said, had always been grateful to
          her. Accordingly the gods decided to entrust this enquiry also to
          Hermes, and he was told to begin with Alexander and to ask him what
          he considered the finest of all things, and what had been his
          object in doing and suffering all that he had done and suffered.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“To conquer the world,”</span> he replied.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> asked Hermes, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“do you think you accomplished this?”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I do indeed,”</span> said Alexander.
          Whereupon Silenus with a malicious laugh exclaimed, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But you were often conquered yourself by my
          daughters!”</span> by which he meant his vines, alluding to
          Alexander's love of wine and intemperate habits. But Alexander was
          well stocked with Peripatetic subterfuges, and retorted,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Inanimate things cannot conquer; nor do we
          contend with such, but only with the whole race of men and
          beasts.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah,”</span> said Silenus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“behold the chicanery of logic! But tell me
          in which class you place yourself, the inanimate or the animate and
          living?”</span> At this he seemed mortified and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hush! Such my greatness of soul that I was convinced
          that I should become, or rather that I was already, a god.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“At any rate,”</span> said Silenus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“you were often defeated by
          yourself.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> retorted
          Alexander, <span class="tei tei-q">“to conquer oneself or be
          defeated by oneself amounts to the same thing. I was talking of my
          victories over other men.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“No more
          of your logic!”</span> cried Silenus, <span class="tei tei-q">“how
          adroitly you detect my sophisms! But when you were wounded in

          were you defeated by him who wounded you, or did you conquer

          more I sacked the town as well.”</span> <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“for you were lying like Homer's Hector in
          a swoon and at your last gasp. It was your soldiers who fought and
          conquered.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Well but I led

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Then Hermes
          addressing Trajan said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now you tell us
          what was the principle that guided all your actions?”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“My aims,”</span> he replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“were the same as Alexander's, but I acted with more
          prudence.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> said
          Silenus, <span class="tei tei-q">“you were the slave of more
          ignoble passions. Anger was nearly always his weak point, but yours
          was pleasure of the vilest and most infamous sort.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Plague take you!”</span> exclaimed
          Dionysus, <span class="tei tei-q">“You keep railing at them all and
          you don't let them say a word for themselves. However, in their
          case there was some ground for your sarcasms, but now consider well
          what you can find to criticise in Marcus. For in my opinion he is a
          man, to quote Simonides, <span class="tei tei-q">‘four-square and
          made without a flaw.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_669" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">669</span></span></a> Then
          Hermes addressed Marcus and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And you,
          Verus, what did you think the noblest ambition in life?”</span> In
          a low voice he answered modestly, <span class="tei tei-q">“To
          imitate the gods.”</span> This answer they at once agreed was
          highly noble and in fact the best possible. And even Hermes did not
          wish to cross-examine him further, since he was convinced that
          Marcus would answer every question equally well. The other gods
          were of the same mind; only Silenus cried <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By Dionysus I shall not let this sophist off so
          easily. Why then did you eat bread and drink wine and not ambrosia
          and nectar like us?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span>
          he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“it was not in the fashion of
          my meat and drink that I thought to imitate the gods. But I
          nourished my body because I believed, though perhaps falsely, that
          even your bodies require to be nourished by the fumes of sacrifice.
          Not that I supposed I ought to imitate you in that respect, but
          rather your minds.”</span> For the moment Silenus was at a loss as
          though he had been hit by a good boxer,<a id="noteref_670" name=
          "noteref_670" href="#note_670"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">670</span></span></a> then
          he said <span class="tei tei-q">“There is perhaps something in what
          you say; but now tell me what did you think was really meant by
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘imitating the gods.’</span> ”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Having the fewest possible needs and doing
          good to the greatest possible number.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Do you mean to say,”</span> he asked, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that you had no needs at all?”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I,”</span> said Marcus, <span class="tei tei-q">“had
          none, but my wretched body had a few, perhaps.”</span> Since in
          this also Marcus seemed to have answered wisely, Silenus was at a
          loss, but finally fastened on what he thought was foolish and
          unreasonable in the Emperor's behaviour to his son and his wife, I
          mean in enrolling the latter among the deified and entrusting the
          empire to the former. <span class="tei tei-q">“But in that
          also,”</span> said the other, <span class="tei tei-q">“I did but
          imitate the gods. I adopted the maxim of Homer when he says
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the good and prudent man loves and
          cherishes his own wife,’</span><a id="noteref_671" name=
          "noteref_671" href="#note_671"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a> while
          as to my son I can quote the excuse of Zeus himself when he is
          rebuking Ares: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Long ago,’</span> he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘I should have smitten thee with a
          thunderbolt, had I not loved thee because thou art my
          son.’</span><a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href=
          "#note_672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">672</span></span></a>
          Besides, I never thought my son would prove so wicked. Youth ever
          vacillates between the extremes of vice and virtue, and if in the
          end he inclined to vice, still he was not vicious when I entrusted
          the empire to him; it was only after receiving it that he became
          corrupted. Therefore my behaviour to my wife was modelled on that
          of the divine Achilles, and that to my son was in imitation of
          supreme Zeus. Moreover, in neither case did I introduce any
          novelty. It is the custom to hand down the succession to a man's
          sons, and all men desire to do so; as for my wife I was not the
          first to decree divine honours to a wife, for I followed the
          example of many others. It is perhaps absurd to have introduced any
          such custom, but it would be almost an injustice to deprive one's
          nearest and dearest of what is now long-established. However, I
          forget myself when I make this lengthy explanation to you, O Zeus
          and ye other gods; for ye know all things. Forgive me this
          forwardness.”</span>)</p>

          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If it was a banker that you wanted

          was proclaimed and the gods cast a secret ballot. It turned out
          that Marcus had most of the votes. After conferring apart with his

          you please, and in future live every one of you under the guidance
          of the gods. Let every man choose his own guardian and
          guide.”</span> After this announcement, Alexander hastened to
          Heracles, and Octavian to Apollo, but Marcus attached himself
          closely to Zeus and Kronos. Caesar wandered about for a long time
          and ran hither and thither, till mighty Ares and Aphrodite took
          pity on him and summoned him to them. Trajan hastened to Alexander
          and sat down near him. As for Constantine, he could not discover
          among the gods the model of his own career, but when he caught
          sight of Pleasure, who was not far off, he ran to her. She received
          him tenderly and embraced him, then after dressing him in raiment
          of many colours and otherwise making him beautiful, she led him
          away to Incontinence. There too he found Jesus, who had taken up

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Julian came to
          Antioch on his way to Persia in the autumn of 361 and stayed there
          till March, 362. The city was rich and important commercially, but
          in Julian's eyes her glory depended on two things, the famous
          shrine of Apollo and the school of rhetoric; and both of these had
          been neglected by the citizens during the reign of Constantius. A
          Christian church had been built in Apollo's grove in the suburb of
          Daphne, and Libanius, Antioch's most distinguished rhetorician, was
          more highly honoured at Nicomedia.<a id="noteref_678" name=
          "noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a>
          Julian's behaviour at Antioch and his failure to ingratiate himself
          with the citizens illustrates one of the causes of the failure of
          his Pagan restoration. His mistake was that he did not attempt to
          make Paganism popular, whereas Christianity had always been
          democratic. He is always reminding the common people that the true
          knowledge of the gods is reserved for philosophers; and even the
          old conservative Pagans did not share his zeal for philosophy.
          Antioch moreover was a frivolous city. The Emperor Hadrian three
          centuries earlier had been much offended by the levity of her
          citizens, and the homilies of Saint <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Chrysostom exhibit the same picture as
          Julian's satire. His austere personality and mode of life repelled
          the Syrian populace and the corrupt officials of Antioch. They
          satirised him in anapaestic verses, and either stayed away from the
          temples that he restored or, when they did attend in response to
          his summons, showed by their untimely applause of the Emperor that
          they had not come to worship his gods. Julian's answer was this
          satire on himself which he addresses directly to the people of
          Antioch. But he could not resist scolding them, and the satire on
          his own habits is not consistently maintained. After he had left
          the city the citizens repented and sent a deputation to make their
          peace with him, but in spite of the intercession of Libanius, who
          had accompanied him to Antioch, he could not forgive the insults to
          himself or the irreverence that had been displayed to the gods.</p>

          god did not permit to devote their muse to mirth and pleasure. For
          constrained as they were to endure toil, now of one sort, now of
          another, they used their poetry to relieve their toil, and by
          abusing those who wronged them they lightened the burdens imposed
          on them by Heaven. But as for me, the law forbids me to accuse by
          name those who, though I have done them no wrong, try to show their
          hostility to me; and on the other hand the fashion of education
          that now prevails among the well-born deprives me of the use of the
          music that consists in song. For in these days men think it more
          degrading to study music than once in the past they thought it to
          be rich by dishonest means. Nevertheless I will not on that account
          renounce the aid that it is in my power to win from the Muses.
          Indeed I have observed that even the barbarians across the Rhine
          sing savage songs composed in language not unlike the croaking of
          harsh-voiced birds, and that they delight in such songs. For I
          think it is always the case that inferior musicians, though they
          annoy their audiences, give very great pleasure to themselves. And
          with this in mind I often say to myself, like Ismenias—for though
          my talents are not equal to his, I have as I persuade myself a
          similar independence of soul—<span class="tei tei-q">“I sing for

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(However the
          song that I now sing has been composed in prose, and it contains
          much violent abuse, directed not, by Zeus, against others—how could
          it be, since the law forbids?—but against the poet and author
          himself. For there is no law to prevent one's writing either praise
          or criticism of oneself. Now as for praising myself, though I
          should be very glad to do so, I have no reason for that; but for
          criticising myself I have countless reasons, and first I will begin
          with my face. For though nature did not make this any too handsome
          or well-favoured or give it the bloom of youth, I myself out of
          sheer perversity and ill-temper have added to it this long beard of
          mine, to punish it, as it would seem, for this very crime of not
          being handsome by nature. For the same reason I put up with the
          lice that scamper about in it as though it were a thicket for wild
          beasts. As for eating greedily or drinking with my mouth wide open,
          it is not in my power; for I must take care, I suppose, or before I
          know it I shall eat up some of my own hairs along with my crumbs of
          bread. In the matter of being kissed and kissing I suffer no
          inconvenience whatever. And yet for this as for other purposes a
          beard is evidently troublesome, since it does not allow one to
          press shaven <span class="tei tei-q">“lips to other lips more
          sweetly”</span>—because they are smooth, I suppose—as has been said
          already by one of those who with the aid of Pan and Calliope
          composed poems in honour of Daphnis.<a id="noteref_683" name=

          you say that I ought to twist ropes from it! Well I am willing to
          provide you with ropes if only you have the strength to pull them
          and their roughness does not do dreadful damage to your

          let no one suppose that I am offended by your satire. For I myself
          furnish you with an excuse for it by wearing my chin as goats do,
          when I might, I suppose, make it smooth and bare as handsome youths
          wear theirs, and all women, who are endowed by nature with
          loveliness. But you, since even in your old age you emulate your
          own sons and daughters by your soft and delicate way of living, or
          perhaps by your effeminate dispositions, carefully make your chins
          smooth, and your manhood you barely reveal and slightly indicate by
          your foreheads, not by your jaws as I do.)</p>

          fingers are nearly always black from using a pen. And if you would
          like to learn something that is usually a secret, my breast is
          shaggy, and covered with hair, like the breasts of lions who among
          wild beasts are monarchs like me, and I have never in my life made
          it smooth, so ill-conditioned and shabby am I nor have I made any
          other part of my body smooth or soft. If I had a wart like

          would tell you so; but as it happens I have none. And by your leave
          I will tell you something else. I am not content with having my
          body in this rough condition, but in addition the mode of life that
          I practise is very strict indeed. I banish myself from the
          theatres, such a dolt am I, and I do not admit the thymele<a id=

          too stupid to appreciate it; like some country fellow who from his
          small means has to pay a tax or render tribute to a harsh master.
          And even when I do enter the theatre I look like a man who is
          expiating a crime. Then again, though I am entitled a mighty
          Emperor, I employ no one to govern the mimes and chariot-drivers as
          my lieutenant or general throughout the inhabited world. And

          me most rarely of all men to vomit my food. And though I remember

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(I happened to
          be in winter quarters at my beloved Lutetia—for that is how the
          Celts call the capital of the Parisians. It is a small island lying
          in the river; a wall entirely surrounds it, and wooden bridges lead
          to it on both sides. The river seldom rises and falls, but usually
          is the same depth in the winter as in the summer season, and it
          provides water which is very clear to the eye and very pleasant for
          one who wishes to drink. For since the inhabitants live on an
          island they have to draw their water chiefly from the river. The
          winter too is rather mild there, perhaps from the warmth of the
          ocean, which is not more than nine hundred stades distant, and it
          may be that a slight breeze from the water is wafted so far; for
          sea water seems to be warmer than fresh. Whether from this or from
          some other cause obscure to me, the fact is as I say, that those
          who live in that place have a warmer winter. And a good kind of
          vine grows thereabouts, and some persons have even managed to make
          fig-trees grow by covering them in winter with a sort of garment of
          wheat straw and with things of that sort, such as are used to
          protect trees from the harm that is done them by the cold wind. As
          I was saying then, the winter was more severe than usual, and the
          river kept bringing down blocks like marble. You know, I suppose,
          the white stone that comes from Phrygia; the blocks of ice were
          very like it, of great size, and drifted down one after another; in
          fact it seemed likely that they would make an unbroken path and
          bridge the stream. The winter then was more inclement than usual,
          but the room where I slept was not warmed in the way that most
          houses are heated, I mean by furnaces underground; and that too
          though it was conveniently arranged for letting in heat from such a
          fire. But it so happened I suppose, because I was awkward then as
          now, and displayed inhumanity first of all, as was natural, towards
          myself. For I wished to accustom myself to bear the cold air
          without needing this aid. And though the winter weather prevailed
          and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my
          servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the
          dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had
          burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot
          coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them,
          brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me
          fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was
          almost choked. Then I was carried outside, and since the doctors
          advised me to throw up the food I had just swallowed,—and it was
          little enough, by Zeus—, I vomited it and at once became easier, so
          that I had a more comfortable night, and next day could do whatever
          I pleased.)</p>

          with these ways of mine, they are naturally resented by a
          prosperous and gay and crowded city in which there are numerous
          dancers and flute players and more mimes than ordinary citizens,
          and no respect at all for those who govern. For the blush of
          modesty befits the unmanly, but manly fellows like you it befits to
          begin your revels at dawn, to spend your nights in pleasure, and to
          show not only by your words but by your deeds also that you despise
          the laws. For indeed it is only by means of those in authority that
          the laws inspire fear in men; so that he who insults one who is in
          authority, over and above this tramples on the laws. And that you
          take pleasure in this sort of behaviour you show clearly on many
          occasions, but especially in the market-places and theatres; the
          mass of the people by their clapping and shouting, while those in
          office show it by the fact that, on account of the sums they have
          spent on such entertainments, they are more widely known and more
          talked about by all men than Solon the Athenian ever was on account
          of his interview with Croesus the king of the Lydians.<a id=

          most ignorant and most quarrelsome of men, is it so senseless then
          and so stupid, that puny soul of yours which men of poor spirit
          call temperate, and which you forsooth think it your duty to adorn
          and deck out with temperance? You are wrong; for in the first place
          we do not know what temperance is and we hear its name only, while
          the real thing we cannot see. But if it is the sort of thing that
          you now practise, if it consists in knowing that men must be
          enslaved to the gods and the laws, in behaving with fairness to
          those of equal rank and bearing with mildness any superiority among
          them; in studying and taking thought that the poor may suffer no
          injustice whatever at the hands of the rich; and to attain this, in
          putting up with all the annoyances that you will naturally often
          meet with, hatred, anger, and abuse; and then in bearing these also
          with firmness and not resenting them or giving way to your anger,
          but in training yourself as far as possible to practise temperance;
          and if again this also one defines as the effect of temperance that
          one abstains from every pleasure even though it be not excessively
          unbecoming or considered blameworthy when openly pursued, because
          you are convinced that it is impossible for a man to be temperate
          in his private life and in secret, if in public and openly he is
          willing to be licentious and delights in the theatres; if, in
          short, temperance is really this sort of thing, then you yourself
          have ruined yourself and moreover you are ruining us, who cannot
          bear in the first place even to hear the name of slavery, whether

          of the gods you flatter me who am a mere man. But it would be best,
          I think, not to flatter even the gods but to worship them with

          harmony with the pursuits or the lives or the temperaments of these

          softening your savage and uncivilised temper—since all avenues are
          closed to anything that might sweeten your disposition,—and the
          worst of all these evils is that you delight in living that sort of
          life and have laid pleasure under a general ban. Then can you feel
          aggrieved if you hear yourself spoken of in such terms? No, you

          admonish you wittily in anapaestic verse to shave your cheeks
          smooth, and then, beginning with yourself, first to show to this
          laughter-loving people all sorts of fine spectacles, mimes,
          dancers, shameless women, boys who in their beauty emulate women,
          and men who have not only their jaws shaved smooth but their whole
          bodies too, so that those who meet them may think them smoother
          than women; yes and feasts too and general festivals, not, by Zeus,
          the sacred ones at which one is bound to behave with sobriety. No,

          fact forgotten how many times I entered the shrine of Daphne, which

          he goes to the temple of Zeus the Friendly One, and offers up
          prayers according to the custom of our ancestors. Now who could put
          up with an Emperor who goes to the temples so often, when it is in
          his power to disturb the gods only once or twice, and to celebrate
          the general festivals which are for all the people in common, those
          in which not only men whose profession it is to have knowledge of
          the gods can take part, but also the people who have crowded into
          the city? For pleasure is here in abundance, and delights whose

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(When I take all
          this into account, I do indeed congratulate you on your good
          fortune, though I do not reproach myself. For perhaps it is some
          god who has made me prefer my own ways. Be assured then that I have
          no grievance against those who quarrel with my way of life and my
          choice. But I myself add, as far as I can, to the sarcasms against
          myself and with a more liberal hand I pour down on my own head
          these abusive charges. For it was due to my own folly that I did
          not understand what has been the temper of this city from the
          beginning; and that too though I am convinced that I have turned
          over quite as many books as any man of my own age. You know of
          course the tale that is told about the king who gave his name to
          this city—or rather whose name the city received when it was
          colonised, for it was founded by Seleucus, though it takes its name
          from the son<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href=

          Seleucus—; they say<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href=

          that out of excessive softness and luxury the latter was constantly
          falling in love and being loved, and finally he conceived a
          dishonourable passion for his own step-mother. And though he wished
          to conceal his condition he could not, and little by little his
          body began to waste away and to become transparent, and his powers
          to wane, and his breathing was feebler than usual. But what could
          be the matter with him was, I think, a sort of riddle, since his
          malady had no visible cause, or rather it did not even appear what
          was its nature, though the youth's weakness was manifest. Then the
          physician of Samos<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href=
          "#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a> was
          set a difficult problem, namely to discover what was the nature of
          the malady. Now he, suspecting from the words of Homer<a id=
          "noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href="#note_720"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a> what
          is the nature of <span class="tei tei-q">“cares that devour the
          limbs,”</span> and that in many cases it is not a bodily weakness
          but an infirmity of soul that causes a wasting of the body; and
          seeing moreover that the youth was very susceptible to love because
          of his time of life and his habits, he took the following way of
          tracking down the disease. He sat near the youth's couch and
          watched his face, after ordering handsome youths and women to walk
          past him, beginning with the queen<a id="noteref_721" name=
          "noteref_721" href="#note_721"><span class=

          herself. Now when she entered, apparently to see how he was, the
          young man at once began to show the symptoms of his malady. He
          breathed like one who is being choked; for though he was very
          anxious to control his agitated breathing, he could not, but it
          became disordered, and a deep blush spread over his face. The
          physician on seeing this laid his hand to his breast, and found
          that his heart was beating terribly fast and was trying to burst
          forth from his breast. Such were his symptoms while she was
          present; but when she had gone away and others came in he remained
          calm and was like a man in a normal state of health. Then
          Erasistratus saw what ailed him and told the king, and he out of
          love for his son said that he would give up his wife to him. Now
          the youth for the moment refused; but when his father died not long
          after, he sought with the greatest vehemence the favour which he
          had so honourably refused when it was first offered to him.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now since this
          was the conduct of Antiochus, I have no right to be angry with his
          descendants when they emulate their founder or him who gave his
          name to the city. For just as in the case of plants it is natural
          that their qualities should be transmitted for a long time, or
          rather that, in general, the succeeding generation should resemble
          its ancestors; so too in the case of human beings it is natural
          that the morals of descendants should resemble those of their
          ancestors. I myself, for instance, have found that the Athenians
          are the most ambitious for honour and the most humane of all the
          Greeks. And indeed I have observed that these qualities exist in an
          admirable degree among all the Greeks, and I can say for them that
          more than all other nations they love the gods, and are hospitable
          to strangers; I mean all the Greeks generally, but among them the
          Athenians above all as I can bear witness. And if they still
          preserve in their characters the image of their ancient virtue,
          surely it is natural that the same thing should be true of the
          Syrians also, and the Arabs and Celts and Thracians and Paeonians,
          and those who dwell between the Thracians and Paeonians, I mean the
          Mysians on the very banks of the Danube, from whom my own family is
          derived, a stock wholly boorish, austere, awkward, without charm
          and abiding immovably by its decisions; all of which qualities are
          proofs of terrible boorishness.)</p>

          he were producing some charming characteristic; and boorishness he
          called dignity, lack of taste he called sobriety, and not yielding
          to one's desires or achieving happiness by that means he called
          manliness. I assure you, by Zeus and the Muses, that while I was

          the poems of Homer and Hesiod. And since she, after giving birth to
          me her first and only child, died a few months later, snatched away
          while she was still a young girl by the motherless maiden<a id=

          so many misfortunes that were to come, I was handed over to him
          after my seventh year. From that time he won me over to these views
          of his, and led me to school by one straight path; and since
          neither he himself desired to know any other nor allowed me to
          travel by any other path, it is he who has caused me to be hated by
          all of you. However, if you agree, let us make a truce with him,
          you and I, and make an end of our quarrel. For he neither knew that
          I should visit you nor did he anticipate that, even supposing I was
          likely to come here, it would be as a ruler, and that too over so
          great an empire as the gods bestowed on me; though they did not do
          so, believe me, without using great compulsion both towards him who
          offered and him who accepted it. For neither of us had the air of
          being willing; since he who offered that honour or favour or
          whatever you may please to call it, was unwilling to bestow it,
          while he who received it was sincere in steadily refusing it. This
          matter, however, is and shall be as the gods will. But perhaps if
          my tutor had foreseen this he would have exercised much forethought
          to the end that I might, as far as possible, seem agreeable in your
          eyes.)</p>

          ridiculed in Comedy—I mean Plato and Socrates, Aristotle and
          Theophrastus. This old man in his folly was first convinced by
          them, and then he got hold of me, since I was young and loved
          literature, and convinced me that if I would emulate those famous
          men in all things I should become better, not perhaps than other
          men—for it was not with them that I had to compete—but certainly
          better than my former self. Accordingly, since I had no choice in
          the matter, I obeyed him, and now I am no longer able to change my
          character, though indeed I often wish I could, and I blame myself
          for not granting to all men impunity for all wrong-doing. But then
          the words of the Athenian stranger in Plato occur to my mind:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Though he who does no wrong himself is
          worthy of honour, he who does not allow the wicked to do wrong is
          worthy of more than twice as much honour. For whereas the former is
          responsible for one man only, the latter is responsible for many
          others besides himself, when he reports to the magistrates the
          wrong-doing of the rest. And he who as far as he can helps the
          magistrates to punish wrong-doers, himself being the great and
          powerful man in the city, let him I say be proclaimed as winner of
          the prize for virtue. And we ought to utter the same eulogy with
          regard to temperance also, and wisdom and all the other good
          qualities that such a man possesses, and which are such that he is
          able not only to have them himself but also to impart them to other
          men.”</span><a id="noteref_747" name="noteref_747" href=

          taught me when he thought that I should be a private citizen. For
          he certainly did not foresee that there would be assigned to me by
          Zeus this lot in life to which the god has now brought me and has
          set me therein. But I, because I was ashamed to be less virtuous as
          a ruler than I had been as a private citizen, have unconsciously
          given you the benefit of my own boorishness, though there was no
          necessity. And another of Plato's laws has made me take thought for
          myself and so become hateful in your eyes: I mean the law which
          says that those who govern, and also the older men, ought to train
          themselves in respect for others and in self-control, in order that
          the masses may look to them and so order their own lives aright.
          Now since I alone, or rather in company with a few others, am now
          pursuing this course, it has had a very different result and has
          naturally become a reproach against me. For we here are only seven
          persons, strangers and newcomers in your city,—though indeed one of

          we have business dealings with no man, nor do we go by any road
          that does not lead to the temples of the gods; and seldom, and then
          not all of us, do we go to the theatres, since we have adopted the
          most inglorious line of conduct and the most unpopular aim and end
          of life. The wise men of Greece will surely allow me to repeat some
          of the sayings current among you; for I have no better way of
          illustrating what I mean. We have stationed ourselves in the middle

          you are doing right and are wise about your own affairs. You ought
          to have taken into account that, when men are wronged, not one of
          them ever blames the magistrates but only the man who has wronged
          him; but the man who seeks to do wrong and is prevented from it,
          far from blaming his proposed victim, turns his grievance against
          the magistrates.</span>)</p>

          among the citizens, even down to the very asses and camels? The men
          who hire them out lead even these animals through the porticoes as
          though they were brides. For the unroofed alleys and the broad
          highways were certainly not made for the use of pack-asses, but
          they are provided merely for show and as an extravagance; but in
          their independence the asses prefer to use the porticoes, and no
          one keeps them out of any one of these, for fear he should be
          robbing them of their independence; so independent is our city! And

          done, O wise citizens, both ye who make such jests and ye who
          welcome and find profit in the jesters! For it is evident that
          uttering them gives pleasure to the former, while the latter
          rejoice to hear jests of this sort. I share your pleasure in this
          unanimity, and you do well to be a city of one mind in such
          matters, since it is not at all dignified or an enviable task to
          restrain and chastise the licentiousness of the young. For if one
          were to rob human beings of the power to do and say what they
          please, that would be to take away and curtail the first principle
          of independence. Therefore, since you knew that men ought to be
          independent in all respects, you acted quite rightly, in the first
          place when you permitted the women to govern themselves, so that
          you might profit by their being independent and licentious to
          excess; secondly, when you entrusted to them the bringing up of the
          children, for fear that if they had to experience any harsher
          authority they might later turn out to be slaves; and as they grew
          up to be boys might be taught first of all to respect their elders,
          and then under the influence of this bad habit might show too much
          reverence for the magistrates, and finally might have to be classed
          not as men but as slaves; and becoming temperate and well-behaved
          and orderly might be, before they knew it, altogether corrupted.
          Then what effect have the women on the children? They induce them
          to reverence the same things as they do by means of pleasure, which
          is, it seems, the most blessed thing and the most highly honoured,
          not only by men but by beasts also. It is for this reason, I think,
          that you are so very happy, because you refuse every form of
          slavery; first you begin by refusing slavery to the gods, secondly
          to the laws, and thirdly to me who am the guardian of the laws. And
          I should indeed be eccentric if, when the gods suffer the city to
          be so independent and do not chastise her, I should be resentful
          and angry. For be assured that the gods have shared with me in the
          disrespect that has been shown to me in your city.)</p>

          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          of this riddle which your wisdom has invented is hard to
          understand, but I obtained interpreters from your city and I was
          informed that these are the first letters of names, and that the
          former is intended to represent Christ, the latter Constantius.
          Bear with me then, if I speak frankly. In one thing Constantius did
          harm you, in that when he had appointed me as Caesar he did not put
          me to death. Now for the rest may the gods grant to you alone out
          of all the many citizens of Rome to have experience of the avarice
          of many a Constantius, or I should say rather, of the avarice of
          his friends. For the man was my cousin and dear to me; but after he
          had chosen enmity with me instead of friendship, and then the gods
          with the utmost benevolence arbitrated our contention with one
          another, I proved myself a more loyal friend to him than he had
          expected to find me before I became his enemy. Then why do you
          think that you are annoying me by your praises of him, when I am
          really angry with those who slander him? But as for Christ you love
          him, you say, and adopt him as the guardian of your city instead of
          Zeus and the god of Daphne and Calliope<a id="noteref_754" name=

          what citizens of Emesa have I ever annoyed? I have however annoyed
          many of you, I may almost say all, the Senate, the wealthy
          citizens, the common people. The latter indeed, since they have
          chosen atheism, hate me for the most part, or rather all of them
          hate me because they see that I adhere to the ordinances of the
          sacred rites which our forefathers observed; the powerful citizens
          hate me because they are prevented from selling everything at a
          high price; but all of you hate me on account of the dancers and
          the theatres. Not because I deprive others of these pleasures, but
          because I care less for things of that sort than for frogs croaking
          in a pond.<a id="noteref_756" name="noteref_756" href=

          he deserves to be praised in comparison with anyone of those who
          pride themselves on their temperance and nobility of soul and on
          their courage above all,—he, I say, once visited this populous and
          luxurious and wealthy city; and when he saw the youths in the
          suburb drawn up in full array, and with them the magistrates, as
          though for some military display, he thought your ancestors had
          made all those preparations in his honour. So he quickly dismounted
          from his horse and came forward, though at the same time he was
          vexed with those of his friends who had preceded him for having
          informed the citizens that Cato was approaching, and so induced
          them to hasten forth. And while he was in this position, and was
          slightly embarrassed and blushing, the master of the gymnasium ran
          to meet him and called out <span class="tei tei-q">“Stranger, where
          is Demetrius?”</span> Now this Demetrius was a freedman of Pompey,
          who had acquired a very large fortune; and if you want to know the
          amount of it,—for I suppose that in all that I am now telling you
          are most anxious to hear this,—I will tell you who has related the
          story. Damophilus of Bithynia has written compositions of this
          sort, and in them, by culling ancedotes from many books, he has
          produced tales that give the greatest delight to anyone who loves
          to listen to gossip, whether he be young or old. For old age
          usually revives in the elderly that love of gossip which is natural
          to the young; and this is, I think, the reason why both the old and
          the young are equally fond of stories. Well then, to return to
          Cato. Do you want me to tell you how he greeted the master of the
          gymnasium? Do not imagine that I am slandering your city; for the
          story is not my own.<a id="noteref_760" name="noteref_760" href=

          philosophers,—I myself never attained to that class though in my
          ignorance I claimed to be a member of it and to have part in
          it,—well he, as I was saying, related that Cato answered not a
          word, but only cried aloud like a man stricken with madness and out
          of his senses, <span class="tei tei-q">“Alas for this ill-fated

          and having children, and know Dionysus the Drink-Giver, only for
          the sake of just so much wine as each can drink at a draught. And

          when, after doing and suffering here I know not what, he went to
          the court of the king in that country, he took with him to remind

          know the word and the thing too—he invited him also from here,
          because of his longing and love for the austere mode of life that
          prevails with you. Now the Celts never made the acquaintance of the
          cotylist, since he was at once admitted into the palace; but when
          the dancers began to display their art in the theatre, the Celts
          left them alone because they thought that they were like men
          stricken with nympholepsy. And the theatre seemed to the men in
          that country highly ridiculous, just as it does to me; but whereas
          the Celts were a few ridiculing many, I here along with a few

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(This is a fact
          which I do not resent. And indeed it would be unjust of me not to
          make the best of the present state of things, after having so
          greatly enjoyed the life among the Celts. For they loved me so
          much, on account of the similarity of our dispositions, that not
          only did they venture to take up arms on my behalf, but they gave
          me large sums of money besides; and when I would have declined it,
          they almost forced me to take it, and in all things readily obeyed
          me. And what was most wonderful of all, a great report of me
          travelled thence to your city, and all men proclaimed loudly that I
          was brave, wise and just, not only terrible to encounter in war,
          but also skilful in turning peace to account, easy of access and
          mild-tempered. But now you have sent them tidings from here in
          return, that in the first place the affairs of the whole world have
          been turned upside down by me—though indeed I am not conscious of
          turning anything upside down, either voluntarily or involuntarily;

          those cities love me more than their own sons, for they at once

          of you, in expiation of your conduct towards the gods, handed over

          on purpose, hurled against the shrine that fire which made the
          strangers who were visiting your city shudder, but gave pleasure to
          the mass of your citizens and was ignored and is still ignored by
          your Senate. Now, in my opinion, even before that fire the god had
          forsaken the temple, for when I first entered it his holy image
          gave me a sign thereof. I call mighty Helios to bear me witness of
          this before all unbelievers. And now I wish to remind you of yet
          another reason for your hatred of me, and then to abuse myself—a

          month, according to your reckoning,—Loos I think you call it—there
          is a festival founded by your forefathers in honour of this god,
          and it was your duty to be zealous in visiting Daphne. Accordingly

          thinking that at Daphne, if anywhere, I should enjoy the sight of
          your wealth and public spirit. And I imagined in my own mind the
          sort of procession it would be, like a man seeing visions in a
          dream, beasts for sacrifice, libations, choruses in honour of the
          god, incense, and the youths of your city there surrounding the
          shrine, their souls adorned with all holiness and themselves
          attired in white and splendid raiment. But when I entered the
          shrine I found there no incense, not so much as a cake, not a
          single beast for sacrifice. For the moment I was amazed and thought
          that I was still outside the shrine and that you were waiting the
          signal from me, doing me that honour because I am supreme pontiff.
          But when I began to inquire what sacrifice the city intended to
          offer to celebrate the annual festival in honour of the god, the
          priest answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have brought with me

          city possesses ten thousand lots of land privately owned, and yet
          when the annual festival in honour of the god of her forefathers is
          to be celebrated for the first time since the gods dispelled the
          cloud of atheism, she does not produce on her own behalf a single
          bird, though she ought if possible to have sacrificed an ox for
          every tribe, or if that were too difficult, the whole city in
          common ought at any rate to have offered to the god one bull on her
          own behalf. Yet every one of you delights to spend money privately
          on dinners and feasts; and I know very well that many of you
          squandered very large sums of money on dinners during the May
          festival. Nevertheless, on your own behalf and on behalf of the
          city's welfare not one of the citizens offers a private sacrifice,
          nor does the city offer a public sacrifice, but only this priest!
          Yet I think that it would have been more just for him to go home
          carrying portions from the multitude of beasts offered by you to
          the god. For the duty assigned by the gods to priests is to do them
          honour by their nobility of character and by the practice of
          virtue, and also to perform to them the service that is due; but it
          befits the city, I think, to offer both private and public
          sacrifice. But as it is, every one of you allows his wife to carry
          everything out of his house to the Galilaeans, and when your wives
          feed the poor at your expense they inspire a great admiration for
          godlessness in those who are in need of such bounty—and of such
          sort are, I think, the great majority of mankind,—while as for
          yourselves you think that you are doing nothing out of the way when
          in the first place you are careless of the honours due to the gods,
          and not one of those in need goes near the temples—for there is
          nothing there, I think, to feed them with—and yet when any one of
          you gives a birthday feast he provides a dinner and a breakfast
          without stint and welcomes his friends to a costly table; when,
          however, the annual festival arrived no one furnished olive oil for
          a lamp for the god, or a libation, or a beast for sacrifice, or
          incense. Now I do not know how any good man could endure to see
          such things in your city, and for my part I am sure that it is
          displeasing to the gods also.”</span>)</p>

          remember to have said at the time, and the god bore witness to the
          truth of my words—would that he had not!—when he forsook your
          suburb which for so long he had protected, and again during that
          time of storm and stress<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775"

          he turned in the wrong direction the minds of those who were then
          in power and forced their hands. But I acted foolishly in making
          myself odious to you. For I ought to have remained silent as, I
          think, did many of those who came here with me, and I ought not to
          have been meddlesome or found fault. But I poured down all these
          reproaches on your heads to no purpose, owing to my headlong temper
          and a ridiculous desire to flatter,—for it is surely not to be
          believed that out of goodwill towards you I spoke those words to
          you then; but I was, I think, hunting after a reputation for piety
          towards the gods and for sincere good-will towards you, which is, I
          think, the most absurd form of flattery. Therefore you treat me
          justly when you defend yourselves against those criticisms of mine
          and choose a different place for making your defence. For I abused
          you under the god's statue near his altar and the footprints of the
          holy image, in the presence of few witnesses; but you abused me in
          the market-place, in the presence of the whole populace, and with
          the help of citizens who were capable of composing such pleasant
          witticisms as yours. For you must be well aware that all of you,
          those who uttered the sayings about me and those who listened to
          them, are equally responsible; and he who listened with pleasure to
          those slanders, since he had an equal share of the pleasure, though
          he took less trouble than the speaker, must share the blame.)</p>

          these I should appear admirable in your eyes. But since the length

          to escape the fate that is described in the legend about the kite.
          The story goes that the kite once had a note like that of other
          birds, but it aimed at neighing like a high-spirited horse; then
          since it forgot its former note and could not quite attain to the
          other sound, it was deprived of both, and hence the note it now
          utters is less musical than that of any other bird. This then is
          the fate that I am trying to avoid, I mean failing to be either
          really boorish or really accomplished. For already, as you can see
          for yourselves, I am, since Heaven so wills, near the age)</p>

          But now, in the name of Zeus, God of the Market-place and Guardian

          wronged by me in any way, either all in common or as individuals,
          and is it because you were unable to avenge yourselves openly that
          you now assail me with abuse in your market-places in anapaestic
          verse, just as comedians drag Heracles and Dionysus on the stage

          can you say that, though I refrained from any harsh conduct towards
          you, I did not refrain from speaking ill of you, so that you, in
          your turn, are defending yourselves by the same methods? What, I
          ask, is the reason of your antagonism and your hatred of me? For I
          am very sure that I had done no terrible or incurable injury to any
          one of you, either separately, as individuals, or to your city as a
          whole; nor had I uttered any disparaging word, but I had even
          praised you, as I thought I was bound to do, and had bestowed on
          you certain advantages, as was natural for one who desires, as far
          as he can, to benefit many men. But it is impossible, as you know
          well, both to remit all their taxes to the taxpayers and to give
          everything to those who are accustomed to receive gifts. Therefore
          when it is seen that I have diminished none of the public
          subscriptions which the imperial purse is accustomed to contribute,
          but have remitted not a few of your taxes, does not this business
          seem like a riddle?)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(However, it
          becomes me to be silent about all that I have done for all my
          subjects in common, lest it should seem that I am purposely as it
          were singing my praises with my own lips, and that too after
          announcing that I should pour down on my own head many most
          opprobrious insults. But as for my actions with respect to you as
          individuals, which, though the manner of them was rash and foolish,
          nevertheless did not by any means deserve to be repaid by you with
          ingratitude, it would, I think, be becoming for me to bring them
          forward as reproaches against myself; and these reproaches ought to
          be more severe than those I uttered before, I mean those that
          related to my unkempt appearance and my lack of charm, inasmuch as
          they are more genuine since they have especial reference to the
          soul. I mean that before I came here I used to praise you in the
          strongest possible terms, without waiting to have actual experience
          of you, nor did I consider how we should feel towards one another;
          nay, since I thought that you were sons of Greeks, and I myself,
          though my family is Thracian, am a Greek in my habits, I supposed
          that we should regard one another with the greatest possible
          affection. This example of my rashness must therefore be counted as
          one reproach against me. Next, after you had sent an embassy to
          me—and it arrived not only later than all the other embassies, but
          even later than that of the Alexandrians who dwell in Egypt,—I
          remitted large sums of gold and of silver also, and all the tribute
          money for you separately apart from the other cities; and moreover
          I increased the register of your Senate by two hundred members and

          You nominated a Senator, and then before his name had been placed
          on the register, and the scrutiny of his character was still
          pending, you thrust this person into the public service. Then you
          dragged in another from the market-place, a man who was poor and
          who belonged to a class which in every other city is counted as the
          very dregs, but who among you, since of your excessive wisdom you
          exchange rubbish for gold, enjoys a moderate fortune; and this man
          you elected as your colleague. Many such offences did you commit
          with regard to the nominations, and then when I did not consent to
          everything, not only was I deprived of the thanks due for all the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Now these were
          very trivial matters and could not so far make the city hostile to
          me. But my greatest offence of all, and what aroused that violent
          hatred of yours, was the following. When I arrived among you the
          populace in the theatre, who were being oppressed by the rich,
          first of all cried aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">“Everything
          plentiful; everything dear!”</span> On the following day I had an
          interview with your powerful citizens and tried to persuade them
          that it is better to despise unjust profits and to benefit the
          citizens and the strangers in your city. And they promised to take
          charge of the matter, but though for three successive months I took
          no notice and waited, they neglected the matter in a way that no
          one would have thought possible. And when I saw that there was
          truth in the outcry of the populace, and that the pressure in the
          market was due not to any scarcity but to the insatiate greed of
          the rich, I appointed a fair price for everything, and made it
          known to all men. And since the citizens had everything else in
          great abundance, wine, for instance, and olive oil and all the
          rest, but were short of corn, because there had been a terrible
          failure of the crops owing to the previous droughts, I decided to
          send to Chalcis and Hierapolis and the cities round about, and from
          them I imported for you four hundred thousand measures of corn. And
          when this too had been used, I first expended five thousand, then
          later seven thousand, and now again ten thousand
          bushels—<span class="tei tei-q">“modii”</span><a id="noteref_787"

          they are called in my country—all of which was my very own
          property; moreover I gave to the city corn which had been brought
          for me from Egypt; and the price which I set on it was a silver
          piece, not for ten measures but for fifteen, that is to say, the
          same amount that had formerly been paid for ten measures. And if in
          summer, in your city, that same number of measures is sold for that
          sum, what could you reasonably have expected at the season when, as
          the Boeotian poet says, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a cruel

          your rich men do? They secretly sold the corn in the country for an
          exaggerated price, and they oppressed the community by the expenses
          that private persons had to incur. And the result is that not only
          the city but most of the country people too are flocking in to buy
          bread, which is the only thing to be found in abundance and cheap.
          And indeed who remembers fifteen measures of corn to have been sold
          among you for a gold piece, even when the city was in a prosperous
          condition? It was for this conduct that I incurred your hatred,
          because I did not allow people to sell you wine and vegetables and
          fruit for gold, or the corn which had been locked away by the rich
          in their granaries to be suddenly converted by you into silver and
          gold for their benefit. For they managed the business finely

          then when I acted thus that I should not please everybody, only I
          cared nothing about that. For I thought it was my duty to assist
          the mass of the people who were being wronged, and the strangers
          who kept arriving in the city both on my account and on account of
          the high officials who were with me. But since it is now, I think,
          the case that the latter have departed, and the city is of one mind
          with respect to me—for some of you hate me and the others whom I
          fed are ungrateful—I leave the whole matter in the hands of

          will betake myself to some other nation and to citizens of another
          sort. Nor will I even remind you how you treated one another when
          you asserted your rights nine years ago; how the populace with loud
          clamour set fire to the houses of those in power, and murdered the
          Governor; and how later they were punished for these things
          because, though their anger was justified, what they did exceeded
          all limits.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Why, I repeat,
          in Heaven's name, am I treated with ingratitude? Is it because I
          feed you from my own purse, a thing which before this day has never
          happened to any city, and moreover feed you so generously? Is it
          because I increased the register of Senators? Or because, when I
          caught you in the act of stealing, I did not proceed against you?
          Let me, if you please, remind you of one or two instances, so that
          no one may think that what I say is a pretext or mere rhetoric or a
          false claim. You said, I think, that three thousand lots of land
          were uncultivated, and you asked to have them; and when you had got
          them you all divided them among you though you did not need them.
          This matter was investigated and brought to light beyond doubt.
          Then I took the lots away from those who held them unjustly, and
          made no inquiries about the lands which they had before acquired,
          and for which they paid no taxes, though they ought most certainly
          to have been taxed, and I appointed these men to the most expensive
          public services in the city. And even now they who breed horses for
          you every year hold nearly three thousand lots of land exempt from
          taxation. This is due in the first place to the judgment and
          management of my uncle and namesake<a id="noteref_792" name=
          "noteref_792" href="#note_792"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">792</span></span></a> but
          also to my own kindness; and since this is the way in which I
          punish rascals and thieves, I naturally seem to you to be turning
          the world upside down. For you know very well that clemency towards
          men of this sort increases and fosters wickedness among
          mankind.)</p>

          wrong that has been done to me, because I transformed your
          graciousness to ungracious ways. This therefore is the fault of my

              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>
